/**
 * Build a converted-agents kind descriptor for runtimes whose agent `.md` files

 *
 * Agent filenames are preserved verbatim (the prefix is already embedded in the
 * agent stem — e.g. `gsd-planner.md`).
 *
 * #1173 SCOPE, updated by #2875 Part 2 (the agents-bypass closure) — measured
 * against the tree, not the ADR-3574 framing that preceded it:
 *
 * Of the four blockers this comment used to name for wiring `bin/install.js`'s
 * inline agent loop against this resolver, THREE were already stale by the
 * time #2875 measured them and are not re-litigated here: Copilot's
 * `.agent.md` rename (the loop's own `destName = entry.name` comment records
 * the ternary dropped in #2099; the descriptor fold applies it via
 * `hostBehaviors.agentFileExtension`), the cross-cutting path-prefix rewrite +
 * attribution (`stageAgentsForRuntimeWithConverter` already applies
 * `applyAgentPathRewrites` -> `processAttribution` when `agentCtx` is
 * present), and stale-file cleanup (`_removeGsdEntries` prunes every
 * `gsd-`-prefixed entry in a kind's destSubpath, broader than the loop's own
 * extension-gated check).
 *
 * The fourth — config-reading steps — was the real gap, and #2875 Part 2
 * closed it: `stageAgentsForRuntimeWithConverter` now takes a per-file
 * `agentName` (`agentCtx.agentName`, ADR-1235 §1) and a `targetDir`
 * (`agentCtx.targetDir`), which together let it (a) run a post-converter
 * frontmatter-extensions step (`applyAgentFrontmatterExtensions`, driven by
 * `hostBehaviors.agentFrontmatterExtensions` — Claude's `effort` +
 * `disallowedTools` injection) and (b) let THIS function resolve a per-agent
 * model override (`installModelOverrideResolver.resolveAgentModelOverride`,
 * `model_overrides[agent]` > `model_profile_overrides.<rt>.<tier>` > omit)
 * before invoking a converter that needs it (kilo/opencode). Both pieces —
 * plus a data-driven Hermes branding converter
 * (`convertClaudeAgentToHermesAgent`, reading `hostBehaviors.brandingRewrites`
 * rather than a hardcoded string table) — are single-sourced: `bin/install.js`
 * requires the SAME functions this module does, so its inline loop and the
 * descriptor path can no longer independently drift (the CLAUDE.md
 * "Generative Fix Divergence" class the prior duplication risked).
 *
 * `tests/agent-descriptor-parity.test.cjs` proves byte-identical output
 * between the inline loop and a SYNTHETIC descriptor registry (the same
 * override seam `resolveRuntimeArtifactLayoutFromRegistry` exposes) for all
 * six runtimes the inline loop still served: claude, cline, codex, hermes,
 * kilo, opencode.
 *
 * Both findings the prior revision of this comment named as STILL deferred
 * are now CLOSED (#2875 Part 2 Task A/B/C), measured against the real
 * `capability.json` entries and the real production entry points, not
 * argued from this module alone:
 *
 * 1. **kilo/opencode reaching `layout.kinds`.** `installEngine.
 *    installAgentsKindStandalone` (install-engine.cts) is called from inside
 *    `installOpencodeFamilyArtifacts` and resolves the agents kind through
 *    THIS SAME `resolveRuntimeArtifactLayout`/`convertedAgentsKind` path —
 *    `installOpencodeFamilyArtifacts` no longer stages only `commands` +
 *    `skills`. `bin/install.js`'s legacy-flat local path (claude-local,
 *    `hostBehaviors.localInstallStyle === 'legacy-flat'`) reaches the SAME
 *    generic loop only via `installRuntimeArtifacts`'s conditional
 *    `_isSkillsRuntime` branch; a call to `installAgentsKindStandalone` was
 *    added at claude-local's own call site to cover that scope too — the
 *    install-tree golden fixture (`tests/fixtures/install-tree/claude-local.json`)
 *    is what caught the gap when it was first missed.
 * 2. **`/gsd:surface` / `applySurface` activation.** Confirmed convergent,
 *    not merely non-broken: for all six runtimes (claude, cline, codex,
 *    hermes, kilo, opencode), staging via `applySurface` into a freshly
 *    wiped `agents/` directory produces byte-identical output (including
 *    filenames) to `installRuntimeArtifacts`'s own write — verified directly
 *    against the built registry, not inferred.
 *
 * The inline loop (`_DESCRIPTOR_AGENTS_RUNTIMES` and the `bin/install.js`
 * agent-staging block it gated) is DELETED — every runtime the registry
 * declares an `agents` kind for is descriptor-driven now, including a
 * seventh runtime (`kimi-code`) this comment's own prior measurement missed
 * (it fell through the inline loop's generic `else if` branch, same as
 * claude, with no dedicated dialect arm — caught by the same golden fixture).
 *
 * Codex's `config.toml [agents.gsd-*]` strip (`bin/install.js`, under
 * `isMinimalMode` + `hostBehaviors.tomlConfigInstall`) remains the one
 * genuinely out-of-scope constraint: it mutates a host config file, not the
 * agents directory, and no descriptor kind models host-config mutation. It
 * stays exactly where it is.
 *
 * Mirrors the `convertedCommandsKind` pattern (#785).
