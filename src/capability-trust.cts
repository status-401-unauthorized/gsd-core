/**
 * Capability trust gate — ADR-1244 Phase 4 (Decision D5 + the compatibility half of D6), extended
 * by ADR-2782 Phase 3 (#2796) with a FOURTH executable-surface class (the reviewer lane), and by
 * ADR-2363 Phase 1 (#3248) with a FIFTH, NON-executable class: the instruction surface.
 *
 * PURE module. It computes *what* a capability would do and *whether* policy allows it; it
 * never mutates the filesystem and never performs I/O beyond reading staged files to confirm
 * declared executable artifacts exist. The actual consent decision (yes/no) is passed in by the
 * caller — GSD has no interactive-prompt layer in lib (the runtime/CLI edge owns that), so the
 * gate stays testable and side-effect-free. See docs/explanation/capability-trust-model.md.
 *
 * LEAF MODULE — imports ONLY: node:fs, node:path, and ./semver-compare.cjs.
 *
 * ADR-2782 D5 (#2796): a `reviewer` lane is piped the plan text, requirements, research findings
 * and CONTEXT.md decisions, then its output is read back into REVIEWS.md — making it an executable
 * surface exactly like a hook, command module, or MCP server, and it is disclosed and consent-bound
 * the same way. `disclosureSignature` appends the lane element to its output ONLY when at least one
 * lane is declared (D4.5) — a lane-free manifest's signature stays byte-identical to before this
 * class existed, so no already-consented capability re-prompts on upgrade. The RESOLVED host (as
 * opposed to the declared `hostConfigKey`) is disclosed to a human but deliberately EXCLUDED from
 * the signature — the loader has no config resolver and must compute the same signature as the
 * lifecycle (constraint 2, `.gsd/phase/chore-2796-reviewer-trust-disclosure/40-design.md`).
 *
 * ADR-2363 D5 (#3248): a capability's declared `skills` are INSTRUCTION surfaces — their bodies are
 * copied verbatim into the user's agent instruction context, so their reach is bounded only by what
 * the agent will do when told. They are disclosed BY NAME and never content-scanned (D2 —
 * Kerckhoffs: a shipped rule set is readable by the adversary who installs it). Unlike the four
 * executable classes they never set `hasExecutable` (D3) and never enter `disclosureSignature` (D4):
 * folding them in would perturb the stored signature of every already-consented skill-bearing
 * capability and fire a spurious re-consent on its next upgrade — the harm ADR-2782 D4 rule 5
 * already forbids. Any future signature binding arrives as a versioned v2, never an in-place
 * re-encoding of v1. ADR-2363 D3's class table names "skills, agents", but third-party `agents[]`
 * are deliberately EXCLUDED here: `stageAgentsForRuntimeWithConverter` (`src/install-profiles.cts`)
 * takes only a source directory, with no registry-aware third-party staging path the way
 * `readInstalledCapabilitySkill` gives skills — so a declared agent is never actually staged into
 * the instruction context, and disclosing it would name a surface that does not exist. Agents stay
 * unimplemented pending a maintainer decision.
 *
 * Exports:
 *   RESERVED_NAMESPACES               — id prefixes third parties may not claim
 *   discloseExecutableSurfaces(...)   — enumerate the four executable classes + instruction surfaces
 *   collectReviewerLaneSurfaces(...)  — the reviewer-lane collector, independently testable
 *   collectInstructionSurfaces(...)   — the instruction-surface collector, independently testable

 *   checkEngines(manifest, host)      — engines.gsd hard gate + compatVersions downgrade
 *   evaluateInstallTrust(args)        — compose: source + namespace + engines + disclosure
 *   executableSetChanged(old, new)    — did the executable surface set change between versions?
 *   summarizeDisclosure(disclosure)   — human-readable consent-prompt lines
 *   summarizeInstructionSurfaces(d)   — the instruction-surface section of the consent summary

 *
 * Recorded here rather than only in the PR that found it: reachability rests entirely on the ingest
