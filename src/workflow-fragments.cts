/**
 * Workflow Fragments — in-file `<!-- gsd:section -->` marker parser/composer
 * for GSD workflow markdown files (ADR-1671 epic #1671, Phase 3 / issue #2930,
 * `.gsd/phase/chore-2930-fragmentize-xl-workflow/40-design.md`).
 *
 * Pure module: no I/O, no dependency beyond node built-ins and the shared
 * budget-trim seam `context-composer.cjs` (issue #2929). Emission order is
 * `parseWorkflowSections` -> `toFragments` -> `composeWithinBudget` ->
 * `renderFragments` (= `composeWorkflow`), run BEFORE the per-runtime
 * converters so a marker attribute never reaches a path-rewrite regex.
 *
 * ## Marker grammar (CLOSED)
 *
 * Open:  a line whose only content (after trimming leading/trailing
 *        whitespace) is `<!-- gsd:section id="<id>" when="<when>" -->`.
 * Close: a line whose only content is `<!-- /gsd:section -->`.
 *
 * Attribute order is free and inner spacing is flexible (Postel on FORMAT);
 * `id` and `when` VALUES are validated strictly and fail closed (Postel is
 * deliberately NOT applied to semantics — an unrecognized `when` is an
 * authoring instruction that must never be silently dropped). `id` matches
 * `/^[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?$/`; `when` must be `===` exactly one
 * entry of the frozen {@link WHEN_VOCABULARY} — no operators, no negation,
 * no nesting (Greenspun's Tenth Rule: extending the vocabulary is a
 * coordinated ADR amendment, never an organic edit).
 *
 * ## Partition invariant
 *
 * `parseWorkflowSections` returns sections that PARTITION the document:
 * every byte that is not part of a marker LINE belongs to exactly one
 * section, in document order. Text outside any marker pair becomes a
 * synthesized gap section (`explicit: false`, id `gap-<n>`, n from 0). A
 * marker line is removed IN FULL — text and its original line terminator —
 * so an unmarked document (88 of 89 workflows today) parses to exactly one
 * implicit gap fragment and composes back byte-identical.
 *
 * Line splitting is CRLF-aware per line (not `content.split('\n')`, which
 * would leave a stray `\r` glued to `.text` and cannot express a mixed
 * CRLF-marker/LF-body document): {@link splitLinesPreservingEol} records
 * each line's own terminator (`''`, `'\n'`, or `'\r\n'`) so reassembly is
 * exact regardless of line-ending mixture.
 *
 * ## Fence + comment interleaving (the highest-risk code here)
 *
 * A marker is structural only when it is NOT inside a fenced code block and
 * NOT inside an unrelated HTML comment (`<!-- gsd:loop-host ... -->` is a
 * different marker family entirely and is left untouched by construction —
 * it does not match the `gsd:section` token). Fences and comments are
 * scanned in ONE left-to-right interleaved pass with two mutually exclusive
 * states (`fence`, `inComment`), copying the discipline documented in
 * `src/context-predicates.cts`'s module comment (DEFECT.CONTEXT-PREDICATES-
 * COMMENT-FENCE-BLIND, #2928): while a fence is open, only a matching closer
 * can end it (a `<!--`/`-->` token on a fenced line is fence content, never
 * a comment boundary); while a comment is open, only a `-->` token can end
 * it (a fence delimiter inside it is comment content, never a fence
 * boundary); when neither is open, a comment opener is checked BEFORE a
 * fence opener (HTML comments are lexically outermost). A two-pass design
 * (mask one construct, then scan for the other) resolves this wrongly in
 * one direction and silently skips to EOF — that is the exact defect this
 * module avoids by construction. An unclosed fence at EOF does NOT throw;
 * everything after it is simply literal.
 *
 * One deliberate refinement beyond a naive "does the trimmed line START
 * WITH `<!--` and END WITH `-->`" check: whether a comment PERSISTS past
 * the current line is decided by `.includes('-->')` (does a close token
 * appear anywhere on the line), not by `.endsWith('-->')`. A line like
 * `<!-- TODO: fix --> some trailing prose` closes its comment on the same
 * line and must not swallow the rest of the document — it is simply not a
 * `gsd:section` marker (a marker's grammar requires the comment to be the
 * line's ONLY content), and is left as ordinary content in whichever
 * section/gap contains it.
 *
 * Known inherited limitation (shared with `context-predicates.cts`, not a
 * regression introduced here): comment-open detection is anchored to the
 * start of the trimmed line. An HTML comment that opens *mid-line* (prose
 * followed by an unclosed `<!--`) is not tracked, so a `gsd:section`-shaped
 * line appearing on a later line inside that comment would be misread as
 * real. GSD workflow markers are always authored on their own line, so this
 * does not affect the production shape; documented here rather than papered
 * over.
 *
 * ADR-457 build-at-publish: compiled by tsc to
 * gsd-core/bin/lib/workflow-fragments.cjs (gitignored).
