/**
 * probe-core — generic spec-phase probe resolution model (ADR-550 Decision 7).
 *
 * Extracted from the edge-probe (the first adapter) once the prohibition probe (#644)
 * proved it the *second* adapter of the same model: one adapter is a hypothetical seam,
 * two is a real one. This module owns everything generic — the resolution lifecycle,
 * the status×verification re-cut, `validateResolution`/`validateRequirement`, the
 * `analyzeCoverage(items, resolutions?, validators)` merge/rollup/orphan-reject engine,
 * the `byVerification` rollup, and the `runProbeCli` I/O scaffold. Each probe is a thin
 * adapter: it supplies the proposal logic (deterministic for edge, LLM-recall for
 * prohibition) and its closed vocabularies via injected validators.
 *
 * Authored as strict TypeScript (`src/probe-core.cts`) and compiled by
 * `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` to the gitignored runtime artifact
 * `gsd-core/bin/lib/probe-core.cjs`. Do NOT hand-write the `.cjs`; it is emitted.
 *
 * Two orthogonal axes (the re-cut):
 *   - status: resolved | dismissed | unresolved   — the resolution LIFECYCLE (shared)
 *   - verification: <probe-defined> | null          — HOW a resolved item is verified
 * The edge adapter declares `verification: explicit | backstop`; the prohibition adapter
 * (#644) will declare `test | judgment`. Splitting the axes keeps the lifecycle enum free
 * of a verification fact and lets a sibling probe add its own tiers without a parallel enum.
 *
 * Typing is hybrid (ADR-550 #5): generic type params for adapter DX, but enforcement runs
 * through injected runtime validators, because the CLI executes over JSON where TS types are
 * erased. The contract test pins the validators, not the types.
