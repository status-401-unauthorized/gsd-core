/**
 * Codex Agent TOML — typed IR for `~/.codex/agents/<agent>.toml` (#3243, ADR-2313).
 *
 * A genuine leaf: node builtins only. This is a **document model**, not a policy —
 * it knows how to parse/render/strip two known keys (`model`,
 * `model_reasoning_effort`) from a Codex agent `.toml`. It does NOT know which
 * `model` values are illegal for Codex (that predicate — Anthropic-flavored
 * detection — stays in `model-catalog.cts`; callers decide what to strip).
 *
 * Moved here (not copied) from `agent-install-check.cts` (#3242, Phase 2), which
 * wrote the hard half: block-range detection, BOM stripping, TOML value
 * unquoting, and the lenient header scan. That module's behavior is UNCHANGED —
 * it imports `stripBOM`/`scanTomlLines` from here and its regression suite
 * (`tests/agent-install-check.test.cjs`) is the proof.
 *
 * ── The reconciliation (40-design.md) ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Phase 2's reader and this phase's writer disagree on how to handle an
 * unterminated `developer_instructions` block, deliberately:
 *
 *   - The READER (`scanTomlLines`, used directly by `checkCodexModelPosture`)
 *     stays LENIENT: an unterminated block still excludes "the rest of the
 *     file" from the header scan (findDeveloperInstructionsBlockRange's
 *     existing fallback), because misreading prompt prose as a pin is only a
 *     false positive — it wastes a user's time, nothing more.
 *   - The WRITER (`parseCodexAgentToml`, used by the Codex sync) is STRICT: an
 *     unterminated block makes the whole document `{ok:false}`, because a
 *     writer that proceeds on a malformed document risks rewriting it.
 *
 * One block-range detector, two call sites, two policies — never two detectors
 * that could silently drift from each other.
