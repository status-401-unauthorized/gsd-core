/**
 * Planning Snapshot — a parsed projection of `.planning/` (Phase 10, #3308,
 * ADR-3180 §8.1).
 *
 * Composed EXCLUSIVELY from the already-consolidated §7 owners
 * (`getMilestoneInfo`, `listMilestonePhaseDirs`, `isPhaseComplete`,
 * `scanPhasePlans`, `stateFieldValue`, `planningPaths`) plus the frozen
 * `SCOPE` enum. This module introduces no new semantic derivation — it
 * introduces exactly one new thing: `worstScope`, a way to combine several
 * independently-scoped owner answers into one composite record without
 * letting a caller treat a non-answer as data.
 *
 * `buildPlanningSnapshot(cwd)` is the sole export consumers reach for;
 * `worstScope` is exported alongside it for direct unit coverage.
 *
 * Design: .gsd/phase/refactor-3308-planning-snapshot-parsed-projection/40-design.md
 *
 * ADR-457 build-at-publish: source in src/planning-snapshot.cts, compiled to
 * gsd-core/bin/lib/planning-snapshot.cjs (gitignored).

 *   corruption — `warnUnusableInput(STATE_UNREADABLE)` fires exactly once,
 *   and all three fields degrade to their UNREADABLE non-answer together.
 * - An unterminated frontmatter fence is reported by `extractFrontmatter`
 *   itself (`FRONTMATTER_UNTERMINATED`) — this function does not duplicate
 *   that diagnostic; it still attempts a body-only field read on whatever
 *   `stripFrontmatter` leaves behind.
 * - `currentPhaseLabel`/`stateStatus` both live under `## Current Position`
 *   (`gsd-core/templates/state.md`) and both use `stateFieldValue`
 *   (`state-document.cts:296`) the exact way `smart-entry.cts:448`/
 *   `state.cts:1561,3273` already call it for `'status'`/`'Status'` — so a
 *   missing `## Current Position` section degrades BOTH to `TRUNCATED` with
 *   a whole-body fallback, together.
 * - `statePhaseTokens` scans the WHOLE document (`verify.cts`'s exact
 *   `PHASE_NUMBER_TOKEN_SOURCE` regex, relocated verbatim from
 *   `verify.cts:1731-1735`; #4257 adds the left word boundary and the
 *   fenced-block/inline-span strip — see the harvest site's comment), not

 * Resolve `planningTracked` — whether `.planning/` matches a gitignore rule

 * Phase 2 of epic #2292). `.gitignore` has no effect on files git already
 * tracks, so a project that committed `.planning/` before ignoring it keeps
 * staging those files forever — while `commit_docs` auto-resolves `false`
 * (`isGitIgnored`, reused below, is exactly what that resolution consults),
 * which is what makes the contradiction invisible. Backs W029
 * (`src/health-diagnostic-rules/config-validation.cts`).
 *
 * Modeled directly on `buildWorktreeHealthField` above (ADR-3180 §8.1 rule 1:
 * a `Rule.check(snapshot)` may perform no ambient I/O, so this `git ls-files`
 * probe lives here, in the snapshot builder, not the rule).
 *
 * `tracked` runs `git ls-files -- .planning` through the module's own
 * injected `execGit` seam: non-empty stdout means at least one path under
 * `.planning/` is in the INDEX — worktree presence is irrelevant (a path
 * tracked in the index but deleted on disk still counts; that is what "the
 * index is what matters" means for this probe).
 *
 * `ignored` reuses `isGitIgnored` (`config-loader.cjs`) — the SAME
 * `git check-ignore -q --no-index` resolution `commit_docs` auto-resolution
 * already calls (`config-loader.cts:824`) — rather than a second,
 * independently-drifting `check-ignore` invocation. Only computed once the
 * `ls-files` probe itself succeeded; a probe that could not run has no
 * grounds to ask a second question either.
 *
 * Degradation mirrors `buildWorktreeHealthField` exactly: not a git repo →
 * `SCOPE.UNREADABLE` + reason `not_a_git_repo` (silent downstream — matches
 * the sibling builder's deliberate treatment of a `.planning/`-only
 * fixture/tmp dir with no git repo at all); a timed-out `ls-files` →
 * `git_timed_out`; any other non-zero exit → `git_list_failed`; a thrown
 * exception → `exception`. Never throws out of the builder.
 *
 * Repo-presence is determined STRUCTURALLY, not by reading `ls-files`'s
 * stderr prose (#3586): git localizes its error text (`LANG`/`LC_ALL`), so a
 * regex matching the English "not a git repository" string silently
 * misclassifies `not_a_git_repo` as `git_list_failed` under any non-English
 * locale — this is exactly the "raw text matching on subprocess output"
 * `CONTRIBUTING.md` bans, applied to production code rather than a test.
 * Instead, on the `ls-files` failure path ONLY (never on the happy path —
 * `buildPlanningSnapshot` runs on every health invocation, and the happy
 * path must stay a single subprocess call), this asks git a structural
 * yes/no question via `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`: exit 0 means we
 * ARE inside a work tree, so the `ls-files` failure was something else →
 * `git_list_failed`; a non-zero exit means we are NOT → `not_a_git_repo`.
 * If that probe itself times out, `result.timedOut` (the shared
 * `isSpawnTimeout` predicate) reports `git_timed_out` — not a hand-rolled
 * timeout check.
 *
 * `ENOBUFS` overflow (#3586 review F2): `execGit` sets no `maxBuffer`, so
 * `spawnSync`'s Node-default 1MB cap applies to `ls-files`' stdout. A
 * `.planning/` tree with enough tracked paths to exceed 1MB makes
 * `spawnSync` report `error.code === 'ENOBUFS'` — exactly the large-tracked-
 * history case this probe exists to catch, and exactly the case most likely
 * to legitimately overflow the buffer. Falling into the generic
 * non-zero-exit path here would misclassify it as `git_list_failed` →
 * `SCOPE.UNREADABLE`, silently dropping the finding in precisely the
 * scenario where it matters most. Overflow is therefore treated as PROOF OF
 * TRACKING, not as a degraded read: `ls-files` only overflows because it had
 * non-empty output to begin with, so `tracked` is unconditionally `true` —
 * detected BEFORE the generic `exitCode !== 0` branch below, so this case
 * never reaches (and never pays for) the `rev-parse` structural probe.

 * convention above): each of the three questions below reads the exact same
 * `scanPhasePlans(fullPhaseDir)` result, so scanning each phase directory
 * three separate times (one function per field) would triple the
 * `readdirSync`/frontmatter-read cost for zero behavioral gain — the three
 * subjects are independent QUESTIONS, not independent SCANS.
 *
 * Enumerated over `allPhaseDirNames`, NOT `phaseDirs` (the
 * current-milestone-windowed twin): the pre-migration `cmdValidateConsistency`
 * (`verify.cts:1521-1608`) walks `collectPhaseRoots(planBase)`'s flat
 * `phases/` root via a plain, unfiltered `readdirSync` — every phase
 * directory on disk, not just the ones the current milestone window
 * resolves as "in scope" — exactly the un-windowed shape `allPhaseDirNames`
 * already exposes for W007 (see that field's own doc comment). Using the
 * windowed `phaseDirs` here would silently narrow C002/C003/C004's coverage
 * relative to the behavior being relocated. Disclosed fidelity note: this
 * does NOT walk `collectPhaseRoots`'s second root (an active archived
 * milestone's `<ver>-phases/` directory) — `allPhaseDirNames` is scoped to
 * the flat `phases/` root only, the same scope every other
 * `allPhaseDirNames`-sourced field already carries.
 *
 * QUESTION 1 — `perPhasePlanNumbering`: the sorted list of `-NN-PLAN.md`
 * sequence numbers physically present (superseded or not — a retired plan
 * still occupied a number), from `allPlanFiles` via the exact
 * `/-(\d{2})-PLAN\.md$/` regex `verify.cts:1558` already uses. This field
 * exposes the raw per-phase number list only; the future C002 rule computes
 * the gap itself.
 *
 * QUESTION 2 — `perPhaseOrphanSummaries`: every SUMMARY.md with no matching
 * LIVE PLAN.md, via `findOrphanSummaries(planFiles, summaryFiles)`
 * (`core-utils.cjs`, `verify.cts:1584` — the same owner
 * `src/health-diagnostic-rules/phase-structure.cts`'s I001 rule already
 * consumes indirectly via `PhaseSnapshot.planCount`/`summaryCount`, for the
 * INVERSE question). Uses the live (superseded-excluded) `planFiles`, not
 * `allPlanFiles` — a superseded plan's summary is still an orphan.
 *
 * QUESTION 3 — `perPhaseWaveMissingPlans`: every LIVE plan (`planFiles`,
 * same live set as Question 2 — a superseded plan legitimately carries no
 * `wave`) whose frontmatter has no `wave` key, via `extractFrontmatter`,
 * mirroring `verify.cts:1596-1603` exactly. A plan file that cannot be read
 * is silently skipped, mirroring `cmdValidateConsistency`'s own outer
 * `catch { intentionally empty }` (`verify.cts:1605-1607`) around this exact
 * loop — a fail-open match to the pre-migration behavior, not a new scope
 * degradation.
