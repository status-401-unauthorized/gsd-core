/**
 * `check tdd-red-evidence` as a gate module (#5139, epic #5056, ADR-5057 §4 first bullet, #3770):
 * it returns a `GateResult`; the command router formats it. Imports no io module and performs no
 * direct console/stdout/stderr write (ESLint-enforced).
 *
 * Validates a persisted RED-phase test-run record for a `type: tdd` plan. Only an INTENTIONAL
 * failure of the target test (verdict RED_EVIDENCE_OK) may authorize GREEN; zero-test discovery,
 * fixture/load crashes, nonzero exits without a failing test, unrelated failures, and unexpected
 * greens are INVALID_RED and block GREEN. The record is the JSON the executor persists after
 * running the RED command: `{ command, exitCode, output, targetTest, targetFile?, expected?,
 * actual? }`. Fail-closed: a missing/unreadable/unparseable record is INVALID_RED (reason
 * `unreadable_record`), never a pass.
 *
 * Argv after the verb: `<record.json>`. The record path resolves against the PROCESS cwd
 * (`path.resolve`), as before the move, and must then stay INSIDE the project directory (realpath
 * containment, ADR-4650) BEFORE anything is read: a record path that escapes it is the usage
 * failure `path escapes its allowed directory: <arg>`, so the gate cannot be made to read — and
 * echo the fields of — an arbitrary readable file (#5139 security review). The path echoed in the
 * payload stays the resolved (not realpath'd) form, unchanged.
 *
 * Consequence of resolving against the process cwd: the CLI runs with cwd === projectDir in every
 * workflow, so a project-relative path (`r.json`) works. Invoked with cwd !== projectDir, that same
 * relative path resolves outside the project and is the usage failure above (it was an
 * `unreadable_record` verdict before containment); an absolute path inside the project works from
 * any cwd.
