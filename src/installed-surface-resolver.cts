/**
 * installed-surface-resolver.cts — Installed Surface Resolver Module (#2872,
 * ADR-2866, Phase 3 — governed by
 * `.gsd/phase/feat-2872-manifest-scope-runtime/40-design.md`).
 *
 * `resolveInstalledSurfaces(runtime?, opts?)` answers a question no existing
 * module answers: "which surfaces actually exist on THIS machine, across
 * BOTH install scopes, right now?" `capability-state.cts` answers "which
 * capabilities are enabled in THIS config dir" — a different question at a
 * different altitude. This module is a new leaf: it reads two scopes at
 * once, composing three already-shipped, already-tested pieces
 * (`resolveScope`, Phase 1; `resolveTriggerSurface`, Phase 2; and
 * `readInstallManifest`, widened in this same phase) rather than
 * re-implementing any of their rules.
 *
 * ── Probe-not-declared keying ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A scope RECORD is keyed by the PROBED scope (`resolveScope`'s own `id`),
 * never by what the manifest itself claims. `manifestVersion`/`runtime`/
 * `scope` recorded inside a v2 manifest are corroboration, not identity: a
 * manifest copied between config dirs, or a `--config-dir` install, must
 * still be reported at the scope this machine actually resolves to.
 *
 * ── Report, don't correct ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * When a declared `runtime`/`scope` disagrees with the probe, this module
 * reports the mismatch (`declaredScopeMatchesProbe: false` /
 * `declaredRuntimeMatchesProbe: false`) and otherwise proceeds exactly as it
 * would for an undeclared (v1) manifest. It never silently substitutes the
 * declared value for the probed one, and never throws on a mismatch — see
 * B-row "Postel's Law" discussion in the design doc.
 *
 * ── One trigger call over installed scopes only ─────────────────────────────
 * `resolveTriggerSurface` is called AT MOST once per runtime, with the
 * scopes that are actually installed on this machine (per manifest
 * presence — never per the new corroboration fields, which is what keeps a
 * v1-only install fully functional with no reinstall required). A
 * hypothetical "what if both scopes were installed" answer is deliberately
 * not offered; #2218 is a fact about THIS machine, not a simulation.
 *
 * ── Installed-ness is manifest PRESENCE, never the new fields ───────────────
 * `installed` is `manifestVersion !== null`. A v1 manifest (no
 * `manifestVersion` key at all, `manifestVersion: 1` after normalization) is
 * a correct manifest written by an older GSD — never a broken one, never
 * grounds for `installed: false`, a warning, or a reinstall prompt.
 *
 * ── Stems come from the manifest, not the source tree ───────────────────────
 * `resolveTriggerSurface` needs `stems`. They are derived from the
 * INSTALLED manifest's own `files` keys (see the private stem-derivation
 * helpers below), never from a roster read of the source tree — a global
 * `claude` install ships no `commands/gsd` source, so a roster read would
 * return `[]` in exactly the configuration #2218 is about. The derivation
 * consumes `isNamespacedByDir` and `composeCommandFilename`
 * (`runtime-artifact-layout.cjs`, #2871 Phase 2's exported helpers) rather
 * than re-deriving either rule as a fourth independent copy.
