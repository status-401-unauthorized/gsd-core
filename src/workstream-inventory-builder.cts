  //
  //  - `heading` — operator-typed marker in the LIVE roadmap. Nothing has been
  //    archived, so every phase the milestone declares should be on disk and
  //    complete. Gate on the full ratio, which also catches the
  //    declared-but-never-scaffolded phases that have no directory to inspect.
  //  - `snapshot` — `milestones/<version>-ROADMAP.md`. The `milestone complete`
  //    run that writes it also MOVES the milestone's phase directories into
  //    `milestones/<version>-phases/` (milestone.cts:783-790) while COPYING —
  //    never truncating — the live ROADMAP (:700-702), so its Progress rows
  //    survive. A CLEAN archive therefore reads 0/N by construction, and gating
  //    it on the ratio alone would strip `milestone complete` from every
  //    archived milestone. But a live in-milestone directory means the archive
  //    is NOT clean — a phase was added or reopened after it, reachable because
  //    `milestone complete` does not advance STATE's `milestone:` field
  //    (state-transition.cts:83, :1335); only `/gsd-new-milestone` does (:1224).
  //    Once any in-milestone directory is live the ratio IS meaningful again, so
  //    the check is the conjunction. Requiring the live directory to itself be
  //    unfinished was too narrow: it let a complete live dir alongside a
  //    declared-but-unscaffolded phase reproduce the reported symptom, since a
  //    dirless phase has nothing to inspect.
  //
  // The whole cross-check is scoped-only, and NOT because of the signal: when
