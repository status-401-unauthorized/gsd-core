/**
 * #2257: the /gsd-debug orchestrator had no contract for a foreground
 * gsd-debug-session-manager return that is usable but non-terminal. Section 4
 * "Session Management" (and the `continue` subcommand's return handling in
 * Section 1c) recognized only two literal-string returns — `DEBUG SESSION
 * COMPLETE` and `ABANDONED` — with no else branch. Any other return (e.g. a
 * mid-investigation progress summary emitted when the manager's own
 * turn/context budget runs out) matched neither and fell through to the user
 * as if the debug session were complete, silently abandoning the
 * investigation mid-flight.
 *
 * The fix defines an explicit non-terminal marker, `CONTINUE_REQUIRED`, that
 * the session manager emits when it must stop before reaching a terminal
 * state (distinct from the two terminal returns and from a genuine
 * user-input/approval `CHECKPOINT REACHED`, which already correctly pauses
 * via AskUserQuestion). The orchestrator treats anything that is not one of
 * the two terminal markers as non-terminal and auto-resumes by re-spawning
 * the session manager from the on-disk checkpoint, bounded by an anti-loop
 * guard.
 *
 * Correction (orthogonal review): the first cut of the anti-loop guard
 * required BOTH `next_action` AND `updated` to be unchanged across two
 * resumes to detect no-progress — but `agents/gsd-debugger.md` overwrites
 * `updated` on every checkpoint write ("Update the file BEFORE taking
 * action"), so `updated` changes every cycle and the AND-condition could
 * never be true, making the guard dead (unbounded auto-resume / DoS
 * regression). The corrected guard keys no-progress detection off
 * `next_action` ALONE and adds an absolute, content-independent hard cap of
 * 3 total auto-resumes per slug per `/gsd:debug` invocation as the real
 * termination bound.
 *
 * debug.md and gsd-debug-session-manager.md ARE the product the runtime
 * loads, so this asserts the deployed text carries the contract — the
 * sanctioned source-text/contract-guard idiom (see
 * tests/fix-2196-debug-agent-handoff.test.cjs).
