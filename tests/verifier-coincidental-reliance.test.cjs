// Two categories from CONTRIBUTING.md's exception matrix, deliberately both:
//   source-text-is-the-product — agents/gsd-verifier.md and
//     gsd-core/templates/verification-report.md are shipped .md whose text IS
//     what the runtime loads, so asserting on the text asserts the deployed
//     contract. Same category tests/verifier-behavior-unverified.test.cjs uses
//     for the sibling #966 axis.
//   docs-parity — the single docs/AGENTS.md assertion is not runtime-loaded
//     text; it holds human documentation in sync with the shipped contract,
//     which has no runtime enumeration API. Claiming the first category for it
//     would overstate what that category covers.

/**
 * Issue #1955 — the verifier grades THAT a truth holds, never WHY.
 *
 * This suite locks the `coincidental-reliance` advisory: for a truth that
 * already reached ✓ VERIFIED, the verifier additionally classifies whether it
 * holds for a guaranteed reason or an incidental one, and names the incidental
 * ones so they can be hardened instead of shipping invisibly.
 *
 * The load-bearing assertions are the INVARIANTS, not the feature:
 *   - the advisory changes neither the verified score nor the overall status;
 *   - it never emits a human-verification item (Step 9 rule 2 would escalate a
 *     passing phase to `human_needed`, contradicting "the phase can still pass");
 *   - ⚠️ PRESENT_BEHAVIOR_UNVERIFIED (#966) stays the ONLY truth state excluded
 *     from `verified_truths`;
 *   - the per-truth token never enters the overall-status vocabulary;
 *   - the qualifier SUFFIXES `✓ VERIFIED` rather than replacing it, so every
 *     substring matcher on the old verdict still hits (Hyrum's Law).
 *
 * Deliberately absent: any assertion on the model's verdict. ADR-550 Decision 5
 * rejects that as vacuous — the CI-testable surface is the deterministic
 * contract, which for a prose rubric is the shipped text.
