 * `spawnSync('bash', ...)` breaks on a Windows checkout — `.gitattributes`
 * `eol=lf` is not always honored by `actions/checkout` on `windows-latest`,

 * finds its match and the parser dies mid-script with "unexpected EOF while
 * looking for matching `"'" or a bare syntax error at the next `{`/`)`.
 *
 * `.split(/\r?\n/)` on the FENCE DELIMITER alone does not fix this — it only
 * protects the boundary match, not the captured body between the fences,

 * parsing runs, is cheaper and safer than normalizing at each extraction
