/**
 * phase-resolution-parity.test.cjs — #2528 resolution-path parity gate
 *
 * The phase-directory matching logic historically existed in three independent
 * copies that had already diverged (different scan idioms, different ambiguity
 * handling): the shared locator (`phase-locator.cjs :: searchPhaseInDir`, used
 * by `findPhaseInternal` and the `init.*` queries), the `find-phase` command
 * scan, and the `phase-plan-index` command scan. #2043/#2232 fixed the shared
 * tokenizer, but any fix needing resolution-level context had to be applied
 * per copy — which is how this bug class kept resurfacing (#2528 is the third
 * instance).
 *
 * A FOURTH copy survived the first pass of that consolidation and was caught in
 * review: `smart-entry.cjs :: detectVerifyFailed`, which resolves the current
 * phase's directory to decide whether its verification failed. It is the worst
 * of the four to get wrong — an unresolved directory reports "not failed",
 * which is indistinguishable from a healthy phase, so the bug is silent by
 * construction. Its absence from this gate is exactly why it was missed.
 *
 * The selection now delegates to one owner (`phase-id.cjs :: matchPhaseDirs`).
 * This gate is the durable guard the #2528 triage asked for: for every corpus
 * scenario, the four resolution paths MUST agree on the same directory for
 * the same bare input — found, not-found, and ambiguous alike. It fails the
 * moment any path re-implements selection and drifts.

// ─── #2528 consumer parity ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
/**
 * The four paths above are the resolution APIs. Review found eight further call
 * sites that had each re-implemented the same "resolve a phase directory from a
 * bare number" step by hand — `dirs.find/some(d => phaseTokenMatches(d, n))` —
 * and so reproduced the #2528 symptom in full even after the owner existed.
 *
 * They are covered here rather than in their own files because the failure this
 * gate exists to catch is not "command X is broken" but "a consumer stopped
 * agreeing with the owner". Splitting them up is how the first four drifted.
 *
 * Every path is observed through the surface a user actually sees, never
 * through the matcher:
 *
 *   1. `phases list --phase N`     → `error: 'Phase not found'` vs listed files
 *   2. `phase next-decimal N`      → `found`
 *   3. `phase remove N --force`    → `directory_deleted`
 *   4. `verify schema-drift N`     → `Phase directory not found` message
 *   5. `validate health`  (W021)   → milestone-complete-vs-roadmap consistency
 *   6. `init manager`              → the overview table's `disk_status`
 *   7. `milestone complete vX`     → the unstarted-phase completion guard
 *   8. `roadmap analyze`           → per-phase `disk_status`
 *
 * Paths 1-4 take the phase as a query. Paths 5-8 never see one: they walk the
 * ROADMAP and ask the disk about each phase in turn, so their "query" is the
 * roadmap heading and their answer is whether the phase looks started.
