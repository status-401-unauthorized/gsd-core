/**
 * Behavioral tests for phase-lifecycle.cjs
 *
 * Module: gsd-core/bin/lib/phase-lifecycle.cjs
 * Exports: deriveProgressFromRoadmap, clampPercent
 *
 * ADR-2143 (epic #2143) migrated deriveProgressFromRoadmap from position-based
 * regexes to the markdown-table schema registry (collectSection + parseMarkdownTable
 * + matchTableSchema against TABLE_SCHEMAS.RoadmapProgress). This suite pins:
 *   - the pre-existing 4-column flat Progress table behaviour (unchanged)
 *   - #2137: the 5-column milestone-grouped Progress table (Phase | Milestone |
 *     Plans Complete | Status | Completed) — the OLD position-anchored regex
 *     assumed "Status" was always the 3rd cell, so it silently returned all-null
 *     for this variant; the schema-registry rewrite reads cells by column NAME
 *     and fixes this.
 *   - the pre-existing 999.x backlog exclusion for totalPhases
