// allow-test-rule: structural-regression-guard [#3143]
/**
 * no-unbounded-spawn-allowlist.test.cjs
 *
 * `eslint-rules/no-unbounded-spawn.allowlist.json` was deleted by #3148 (the
 * terminal wave of epic #3064): the migration reached zero remaining
 * violations, so the allowlist option was dropped from the rule's wiring in
 * `eslint.config.mjs` and `local/no-unbounded-spawn` now runs with no
 * exemption surface at all under `tests/**`. The former D4/D5/D6/D8 guards
 * here (dead entries, baseline ratchet, separator normalization, canonical
 * sort/dedupe) all referenced that now-deleted file and are gone with it.
 *
 * What remains — D7, the inline-disable ban — matters MORE now, not less:
 * with no allowlist to grandfather a file, an inline `eslint-disable`
 * naming this rule is the ONLY remaining way to silence it. This guard is
 * the sole remaining defense against that, so it stays.
 *
 * D7 needs to inspect test-file *contents* for an inline directive that
 * disables this rule by name — the absence of that pattern is the contract
 * this guard protects (a contributor cannot silence the check by disabling
 * it inline instead of fixing the timeout). That is a `readFileSync` +
 * text-search on `.cjs` files, which is exactly what `local/no-source-grep`
 * exists to catch — hence the
 * `// allow-test-rule: structural-regression-guard [#3143]` annotation on
 * its own line above, per CONTRIBUTING.md's documented exemption.
 *
 * The scan covers ALL of `tests/`, RECURSIVELY — not just the top-level
 * directory. `listTestFiles()` walks every subdirectory (`tests/helpers/`,
 * `tests/qa/`, `tests/observability/`, `tests/fixtures/`, `tests/dispatch/`,
 * etc.) via `fs.readdirSync(..., { recursive: true })`. A non-recursive scan
 * left ~37 nested `.cjs` files completely unchecked: a file in a subdirectory
 * could carry both an unbounded spawn AND an inline eslint-disable directive
 * naming this rule (see `GUARDED_RULE` below), and this guard would never see
 * it. With the allowlist gone, this is the SOLE remaining defense against
 * silencing the rule — recursion is not optional.
