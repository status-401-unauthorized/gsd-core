# API-coverage matrix fixture (#2366)

`multi-table-with-summary.md` is the verbatim 15-line `repro-coverage.md`
from #2366's own reproduction, used as a `COVERAGE.md` body and driven
through `check api-coverage.verify-pre <phaseDir>` (paired with a PLAN.md
that integrates an API, so a matrix is required) — the real blocking gate,
not `parseCoverageMatrix()` called in isolation.

Contains, in one file: the canonical `| capability | decision | reason |`
matrix, a second canonical-schema table under a "Transferred to a later
phase" heading (the section-split use case #2366 names as legitimate), and
a decoy 3-column "Coverage summary" table whose header row happens to read
`| tier | INTEGRATE | OPT-OUT |`.

Expected once fixed: 3 rows (`search`, `skip`, `widget`), 0 errors (see
`MANIFEST.json`'s `expectedCounts`/`expectedErrorCount`/`expectedBlock`).
Today's parser instead invents a `tier` capability from the summary table
(silent corruption — zero errors reported for that path) while rejecting
the bolded `skip` decision and two other cells, producing 3 errors and
`block: true` — pinned in `MANIFEST.json`'s `currentBuggyOutput` and
asserted directly in `tests/representative-corpus.test.cjs` (a
characterization of today's known-broken behavior, not a `todo` — see
`tests/fixtures/representative/README.md` for why) until #2366 lands.
