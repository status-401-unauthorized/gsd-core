/**
 * Regression coverage for #4460 (discovered blocking this PR's own Windows
 * CI, unrelated to this PR's actual diff -- fixed inline per this repo's
 * no-defer policy): scripts/check-env.cjs's npm-version check used to
 * collapse every spawnSync failure mode into one message, "npm binary not
 * found on PATH" -- including a TIMEOUT under CI load, which looks
 * identical to a genuine ENOENT (exitCode stays non-zero, stdout stays
 * empty either way). Confirmed live, twice, on real Windows CI: the check
 * now correctly reports "timed out under CI load" for exactly that case.
 *
 * describeNpmVersionCheckFailure is the extracted, pure reason-selection
 * logic. It takes a plain result object shaped like this repo's canonical
 * OS-shell-projection seam's SpawnResultOutput (execNpm,
 * src/shell-command-projection.cts) -- same `timedOut` (error.code ===
 * 'ETIMEDOUT') semantics -- but check-env.cjs computes that shape inline
 * rather than importing the seam itself: that seam's compiled output
 * (gsd-core/bin/lib/*.cjs) does not exist yet when check-env.cjs runs as
 * its own standalone pre-`npm ci` CI step (an earlier version of this fix
 * imported it directly and crashed every real CI job with
 * MODULE_NOT_FOUND). Kept in scripts/lib/ (not scripts/check-env.cjs
 * itself, which runs its CLI unconditionally on require) so it can be
 * required directly here without triggering a real environment check.
