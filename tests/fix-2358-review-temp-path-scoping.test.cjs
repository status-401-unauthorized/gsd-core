/**
 * #2358 — review.md (and ship.md's external peer-review step) wrote every
 * temp file to a hardcoded, phase-number-only path under /tmp
 * (`/tmp/gsd-review-prompt-{phase}.md`, `/tmp/gsd-review-<reviewer>-{phase}.*`,
 * `/tmp/gsd-review-stderr.log`). Two GSD projects with a phase sharing the
 * same small integer number collide on the exact same path; a crashed prior
 * run's leftover file is bait a later, unrelated run can silently read (the
 * reporter forensically confirmed agy read a 3-week-old stale prompt from a
 * DIFFERENT project). Neither file used the portable ${TMPDIR:-/tmp} seam,
 * and review.md had no cleanup.
 *
 * The fix threads a single `mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/gsd-review-XXXXXX"`
 * run directory (RUN_DIR / {run_dir}) through every review.md temp path, and
 * ship.md's stderr capture through a per-run `mktemp` file — eliminating the
 * shared-path collision by construction rather than by convention.
 *
 * review.md and ship.md ARE the product the runtime loads (an AI agent reads
 * and executes these workflow instructions verbatim), so this is a
 * static-content regression against the deployed text, mirroring
 * fix-2194-review-timeout-guidance.test.cjs.
