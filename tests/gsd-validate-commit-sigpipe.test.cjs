// #4429 — `hooks/gsd-validate-commit.sh` must survive a large `commit_types`
// config. Two defects, provably coupled, covered by one suite.
//
// (1) SIGPIPE. The pre-fix hook took the first line of CONFIG_OUT with
//     `printf '%s\n' "$CONFIG_OUT" | head -1`. `head` closes after one line, so
//     `printf` is killed by SIGPIPE once CONFIG_OUT exceeds the 64 KiB pipe
//     buffer, and `set -euo pipefail` aborts the whole hook. The fix — pure
//     parameter expansion — is ALREADY on `next`; it landed INCIDENTALLY in
//     #4537, a PR about commit classification whose message never mentions
//     #4429. Nothing in the tree would notice its removal, and the failure is
//     load-dependent (the reporter: "does not reproduce on an idle machine"),
//     so a reintroduction would surface as an unrelated flaky test.
//
// (2) regcomp. `COMMIT_TYPE_ALT` joined every CONFIGURED type into one regex.
//     bash caps a compiled pattern at 64 KiB; past it `[[ =~ ]]` returns 2, and
//     `if !` cannot tell a COMPILE ERROR from "the subject does not conform".
//     A valid `feat(auth): …` was blocked with CONVENTIONAL_COMMITS_VIOLATION
//     while `feat` sat in its own valid_types.
//
// They are coupled with no gap. Each configured type contributes `len+1` bytes
// to CONFIG_OUT (type + newline) AND `len+1` to the alternation (type + pipe),
// so the two strings are the same size to within the leading flag line. The
// smallest payload that overflows the pipe (N=6059, CONFIG_OUT 65544) already
// puts the alternation at 65592 — past the 65504 ceiling. So (1) cannot be
// tested at all until (2) is fixed, which is why both land together.

  // #5068 — this CONTROL used to depend on winning a REAL race: a worker

  // opendir. On a loaded bench it lost that race 136 times in a row, and the
  // churn itself was a 15-second IO storm on the shared tmpdir. Real-race
  // tests are deleted and replaced (RULESET.TESTS.delete-bad-tests).
  //
  // What the defect actually is, read off Node's source (lib/internal/fs/cp/
  // cp-sync.js `copyDir`, src/node_file.cc `CpSyncCopyDir`): an fs.cpSync with
  // NO filter hands the whole walk to the native `cpSyncCopyDir`, which opens
  // every directory it walks with the THROWING form of
  // `std::filesystem::directory_iterator`. Any failure to open one — ENOENT
  // because a concurrent build deleted it, or any other errno — escapes as an
  // uncaught C++ exception; Node is built without C++ exception support, so
  // the process aborts (SIGABRT) and no JS try/catch can intercept it. Passing
  // ANY filter moves the walk onto the JS implementation, whose errors are
  // ordinary, catchable Errors — which is why a deletion driven from a filter
  // callback cannot reproduce this, and why the fix (a filter) works.
  //
  // Two deterministic injections make that exact call fail — no timing:
  //   ENOENT — a REAL deletion at a controlled point. cp-sync.js captures
  //     fs.statSync when it is lazily loaded, so the child wraps fs.statSync
  //     BEFORE its first cpSync; the wrapper deletes the source directory on
  //     the copy's own pre-walk stat of it and returns the (real) stats. The
  //     native walk then opens a directory that no longer exists.
  //   EMFILE — the SUBDIRECTORY case (the staging dir inside hooks/). The
  //     child leaves itself exactly one free file descriptor: the parent
  //     directory's opendir takes it, the staging directory's opendir fails.
  // Both rows pin the abort to the directory_iterator constructor by its own
  // message and path: create_directory and the symlink branch of the same
  // native walk ALSO abort, and a bare SIGABRT cannot tell them apart.
  // Companion rows run the same injections WITH the shipped filter.
