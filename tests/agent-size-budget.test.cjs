/**
 * Agent size budget (measured in BYTES — see #717).
 *
 * Agent definitions in `agents/gsd-*.md` are loaded verbatim into the agent's
 * context on every subagent dispatch. Unbounded growth is paid on every call
 * across every workflow.
 *
 * ## Enforcement model (issue #1074)
 *
 * Mirrors tests/workflow-size-budget.test.cjs — two complementary guards, no
 * tier-max ceiling:
 *
 *   1. Per-agent baseline (the anti-creep): every agent is pinned to its exact
 *      byte size in `tests/agent-size-baseline.json`. Any growth fails with the
 *      file and delta; `npm run size:baseline` records a deliberate change as a
 *      reviewable one-line diff. This replaced the tier-max tighten-only ratchet
 *      (which only bound the single largest agent per tier).
 *
 *   2. Tier hard caps (the outer bound): XL/LARGE/DEFAULT absolute red lines
 *      with real headroom, never raised in normal work. Crossing one means
 *      extracting shared boilerplate to `gsd-core/references/`, not a +N bump.
 *      A net-new agent is DEFAULT-tier, so the DEFAULT cap already bounds it —
 *      no separate new-file cap is needed (DEFAULT is already small).
 *
 * Tiers:
 *   - XL       : top-level orchestrators that own end-to-end rubrics
 *   - LARGE    : multi-phase operators with branching workflows
 *   - DEFAULT  : focused single-purpose agents
 *
 * See:
 *   - https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/1074 (per-file baseline + hard caps)
 *   - https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/717  (bytes, not lines)
 *   - https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/683  (LF-normalized byte count)

// gate"), which until now was the only capped file with one:
//
//   1. the census, printed every run, green or not
//   2. the reserved margin, which REPORTS rather than fails
//
// The margin deliberately does not fail. A cap breach is a red line; a file
// at 96% is not broken, it is a file whose next contributor should know to
// extract before adding. Failing there would turn a warning into a second
// red line and force exactly the +N bumps this policy forbids.
