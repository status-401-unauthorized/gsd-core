/**
 * pause-work-context-detection.test.cjs — regression coverage for #4112.
 *
 * gsd-core/workflows/pause-work.md's "Context Detection" step opens its
 * phase/spike/sketch assignments with `$((`. That is genuinely ambiguous in
 * POSIX-family shell grammar between arithmetic expansion and a command
 * substitution wrapping a subshell. bash and zsh silently fall back to the
 * command-substitution reading when the arithmetic parse fails (undocumented
 * but real — verified empirically), so this construct does NOT throw under
 * bash/zsh. It DOES throw a hard "Syntax error: Missing '))'" under POSIX
 * `sh` (dash), which does not implement that fallback and is the default
 * `/bin/sh` on Debian/Ubuntu (including the CI/bench hosts this repo tests
 * on, and a common default shell for `child_process.exec()`-style spawns
 * with no explicit `shell:` override).
 *
 * An earlier version of this test asserted `bash -n` syntax validity and
 * wrapped a plain `bash -c` execution in assert.doesNotThrow(). Both were
 * wrong: `bash -n` never evaluates arithmetic-context content at parse time,
 * and bash's runtime fallback means a bare `bash -c` execution never throws
 * either. That version passed a full `gsd-test` run (41594/41594, 0
 * failures) against the UNFIXED file — a false green. This version fixes
 * that by asserting on the real, verified failure mode: execution under
 * `dash`/`sh`.
 *
 * A code review of an intermediate version also found that falling back
 * from `dash` to plain `sh` without verifying discrimination could silently
 * produce a non-discriminating test on a host where `/bin/sh` is
 * bash-compatible (macOS, for example) — `resolvePosixShell` below verifies
 * each shell candidate actually rejects a known-ambiguous `$((` snippet
 * before trusting it, rather than assuming that from the binary name.
 *
 * These tests execute the real fenced bash block extracted from the shipped
 * workflow file against real temp-directory filesystem states — not a mock,
 * not a source-text grep of the fix. Extracting the fence line-by-line (not
 * a single fence-spanning regex — matches this repo's established
 * extraction idiom, e.g. tests/no-hardcoded-home-gsd-tools.test.cjs) reads
 * workflow markdown, not source code; `local/no-source-grep` targets
 * readFileSync of .cjs/.cts/.js/.mjs/.mts/.ts SOURCE files, which this is
 * not. All subprocess calls route through tests/helpers/process-seam.cjs
 * (bounded by construction, never a hand-rolled execFileSync/spawnSync);
 * temp-directory removal goes through tests/helpers.cjs's `cleanup()`.
