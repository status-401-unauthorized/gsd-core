/**
 * Workflow size budget (measured in BYTES — see #717).
 *
 * Workflow definitions in `gsd-core/workflows/*.md` are loaded verbatim
 * into the agent's context every time the corresponding `/gsd:*` command is
 * invoked. Unbounded growth is paid on every invocation across every session.
 *
 * ## Why bytes, not lines (#717)
 *
 * Line count is a poor proxy: markdown tables and fenced code blocks are
 * token-dense, so a line budget over-penalizes prose and under-catches dense
 * additions. Bytes are cheap, deterministic, and need no tokenizer. They are
 * also the UNIT our vendors bound on — Codex caps instruction docs at 32,768
 * bytes (`project_doc_max_bytes`) and truncates past it. We adopt that unit,
 * not that exact number: our XL/LARGE ceilings sit above 32,768 because these
 * are grandfathered top-level orchestrators loaded by Claude, not Codex
 * AGENTS.md docs — the goal is a bounded, ratcheting budget, not Codex parity.
 *
 * ## Why the budget exists at all (the quality argument, not just cost)
 *
 * With prompt caching the per-invocation *cost* premise is weak (cache reads
 * are ~10% of input). The stronger, caching-independent reason is QUALITY:
 * larger context degrades recall and reasoning ("context rot" / attention
 * budget). Lean, high-signal instructions produce better plans. The ceiling
 * protects the agent's attention, not just the token bill.
 *
 * ## The goal this metric is a proxy for (read before gaming it — #717)
 *
 * The real target is bounded *loaded* context. This test measures one file's
 * bytes, but `@~/.claude/gsd-core/references/...` imports are loaded EAGERLY
 * into context. Moving prose into an eagerly @-imported reference shrinks the
 * measured file while leaving (or growing) total loaded context — that is
 * gaming the proxy, not improving the goal. Legitimate extraction is LAZY:
 * content Read only at the step that needs it (see the discuss-phase mode/
 * template tests below, which forbid templates in <required_reading>).
 *
 * ## Enforcement model (issue #1074)
 *
 * Two complementary guards, neither of which is a tier-max ceiling:
 *
 *   1. Differential attribution size ratchet (the anti-creep): every workflow's
 *      byte growth against the base ref is reported with its exact delta by
 *      `tests/emitted-attribution.test.cjs` (via `tests/helpers/emitted-diff.cjs`'s
 *      size ratchet), which fails unless the growth is acknowledged in
 *      `tests/emitted-drift-ack.json` (ADR-2719 §4). This REPLACED the per-file
 *      `tests/workflow-size-baseline.json` snapshot (removed by #2724, ADR-2719
 *      Phase 4 — it conflicted on 7 of 7 PRs that touched it), which itself had
 *      replaced the original tier-max tighten-only ratchet (#597), which only
 *      bound the single largest file per tier and left the other ~85 files able
 *      to grow silently.
 *
 *   2. Tier hard caps (the outer bound): XL/LARGE/DEFAULT are absolute red
 *      lines with real headroom, never raised in normal work. Crossing one
 *      means lazy extraction (the `workflows/discuss-phase/modes/`
 *      progressive-disclosure pattern), not a +N bump. New workflow files get
 *      the Codex `project_doc_max_bytes` anchor (32 KiB) unless explicitly
 *      tiered in the same PR — see `NEW_FILE_CAP` in `tests/helpers/emitted-diff.cjs`.
 *
 * Tiers:
 *   - XL       : top-level orchestrators (e.g., execute-phase, plan-phase)
 *   - LARGE    : multi-step planners
 *   - DEFAULT  : focused single-purpose workflows (target tier)
 *

// document the remaining headroom became a reason to believe there was more
// of it than there was. The headroom census below emits the live numbers on
