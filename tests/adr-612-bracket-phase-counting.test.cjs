/**
 * PR-2 (#2761 / epic #612) — total_phases counts bracket phase headings.
 *
 * `total_phases` is derived TWICE: buildStateFrontmatter feeds `state json`, and
 * cmdStateSync feeds `state sync`. The second carries the comment "Mirrors the
 * logic in buildStateFrontmatter so both report consistent percents (#3242 Bug
 * B)". Teaching one and not the other ships that divergence.
 *
 * TWO ORACLE HAZARDS this file is shaped around:
 *
 *   1. #1446 removed total_phases from the ratchet, so it corrects DOWNWARD
 *      silently. Every assertion here is an EXACT number; "no error" or ">= n"
 *      passes straight through the bug.
 *
 *   2. Reading `state json` after `state sync` measures the READ derivation
 *      twice — sync leaves STATE.md untouched when its computed total already
 *      matches, so the write-path guard is never observed and a mutation to it
 *      survives. The sync assertions below pre-write a WRONG total into the
 *      frontmatter, run sync, and then read THE FILE, so the number asserted is
 *      the one sync actually wrote.

 * The verification filename cmdScaffold writes into `dir` when the phase is

 * (`src/commands.cts`): the PHASE'S OWN padded token.
 *
 * UPDATED at the origin/next merge (#3511): every complete dir used to get a
 * hardcoded `01-VERIFICATION.md`, which was harmless while nothing scoped a
 * phase directory's listing. Upstream #3511 made membership real — in any dir
 * that is not phase 01 that hardcoded name is now (correctly, on BOTH
 * conventions once #612 threads `convention` into the seam) a cross-phase
 * stray, excluded from completion. These fixtures mean "a COMPLETE phase",
 * not "a phase holding another phase's report", so they must write what the
 * scaffolder writes. The stray shape is pinned deliberately, as its own
 * regression block — see "#612 PR-2: a cross-phase stray in a bracket dir"
 * below — so this rename cannot silently stand in for the seam fix.
 *
 * The padding comes from the production `normalizePhaseName` itself (single
 * owner, no fixture drift). What stays fixture-local is the bracket-prefix
 * strip below — deliberately: production does NOT strip `{CODE}.` prefixes
 * (`normalizePhaseName('GSD.02-01')` returns it unchanged via the custom-id
 * arm; scaffold echoes whatever `--phase` form it is given), so a repo's
 * artifact layout is unqualified or qualified depending on how phases were
 * scaffolded. This file's fixtures model the UNQUALIFIED layout; the
 * QUALIFIED layout is modeled by tests/adr-612-bracket-read-tolerance.test.cjs

// The four numbers `total_phases` was hiding.
//
// Every bracket counting assertion above reads `total_phases` and nothing else,
// and `total_phases` is the ONE number the disk-side milestone filter cannot
// move: `Math.max(phaseDirs.length, roadmapPhaseCount)` (state.cts) floors it at
// the ROADMAP count no matter how many directories the filter rejects. So a
// filter that rejects EVERY bracket directory leaves that number right and
// zeroes `completed_phases`, `total_plans`, `completed_plans` and `percent` —
// green suite, `state json` reporting 0% on a repo `state sync` calls 67% in the
// same second. These pin all five.
//
// THE ORACLE IS THE LEGACY TWIN, and it is computed in the same run rather than
// quoted: each test builds the identical repo in the flat legacy spelling and
// asserts the bracket reading equals it, number for number. Exact literals are
// asserted too — an equality alone would pass with both sides broken.
//
// WHY FLAT LEGACY AND NOT M-NN. The M-NN spelling of these shapes cannot serve
// as the oracle: buildStateFrontmatter's #2445 de-dup key is
// `dir.match(/^0*(\d+[A-Za-z]?(?:\.\d+)*)/)`, which captures only the LEADING
// integer, so `02-01-one`, `02-02-two` and `02-03-three` all key to `2` and two
// of the three directories are dropped before they are ever counted. Measured
// on the true base build (d04592de), the M-NN twin of the first shape below
// reads `[3,0,1,0,0]` where flat legacy reads `[3,2,3,2,67]`; the divergence is
// present identically at base and is untouched by this PR. It is a legacy defect
// in a key space bracket directories cannot enter — `GSD.02-01-one` does not
// match that regex at all, so each bracket dir keys to its own name. The
// source's own `phase-id-owner:` sanction at that line records the divergence.

// ─── REGRESSION: the version-less bracket milestone heading now scopes ──────

/**
 * FIXED (#2761 B1, reviewer trek-e blocker). Every other bracket fixture in
 * this repo writes its milestone heading as `## [GSD.02] v2.0: Current` — with a
 * version. ADR-612's canonical form is a NAME and no version
 * (`## [GSD.02] Foundation`), which `isMilestoneBounded`'s own doc comment in
 * state.cts calls out as canonical. Until this fix, that form left the
 * disk-side filter unscoped: directories from BOTH the prior and the later
 * milestone were admitted into the current one.
 *
 * Mechanism, in `extractCurrentMilestone` (roadmap-parser.cts):
 *   - the bracket scope branch selects the right `currentSection`, but
 *   - `preambleCutoff` was driven only by `anyMilestonePattern`, which requires
 *     `v\d+\.\d+` or a status emoji. A version-less roadmap matches none, so the
 *     cutoff fell back to the CURRENT milestone's own offset and every PRIOR
 *     milestone landed in the preamble — whose phase-stripping regex only strips
 *     `Phase N:`-labelled headings, so bracket phase headings survived it; and
 *   - `computeSectionEnd` accepted a boundary only if the heading carried a
 *     version or emoji, so with none present the section ran to EOF and every
 *     LATER milestone was swept in too.
 *
 * The leak was bidirectional and had two sites. The fix: under the bracket
 * scope branch (`bracketScopeConvention === 'bracket'`), both
 * `computeSectionEnd` and the `preambleCutoff` scan ALSO accept a
 * `#{1,2}\s+\[CODE.MM\]` heading as a milestone boundary, built from
 * phase-id.cts's `BRACKET_ID_SRC` (the single owner of the bracket-id grammar)
 * rather than a re-typed literal. `#{1,2}` is the discriminator because bracket
 * PHASE headings are `###` and carry the same `[CODE.MM]` prefix (a `#{1,3}`
 * pattern would match both, which is why the scope branch's own matcher returns
 * the phase headings as well). Reachable ONLY when the bracket scope branch has
 * fired, so version-bearing/emoji repos and non-bracket conventions take the
 * exact pre-existing code path.
 *
 * These tests used to assert the pre-fix reading; they are inverted here as the
 * fix's regression proof, not deleted.

//
//   1. The earliest-of-either comparison added to `preambleCutoff` (taking
//      whichever of the version/emoji match or the bracket match sits first in
//      the document) was only exercised where the two patterns happen to agree
//      on the same heading (every milestone in the REGRESSION block above is
//      uniformly version-bearing or uniformly version-less). A genuinely mixed
//      roadmap — one milestone version-bearing, its sibling version-less — was
//      untested.
//
//   2. `computeSectionEnd`'s `h.level <= 2` conjunct (added alongside the
//      pre-existing `h.level > level` skip) is REDUNDANT whenever the selected
//      milestone heading is level 2 — the ADR-canonical shape, and every
//      existing fixture in this repo: `h.level > level` alone already implies
//      `h.level <= 2` there, so a mutant deleting the conjunct would survive
//      every test written before this one. It is NOT redundant when the
//      selected heading is level 3 (or level 1) — see the fixtures below.

// ─── a sibling milestone is not ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The B1 fix (commit 08d5b0c4) resolved `bracketScopeConvention` only inside
// the `if (headingMatches.length === 0)` gate that also drives SELECTION's own
// bracket fallback. That gate is correct for SELECTION (only try the bracket
// heading shape when the version-string match found nothing), but
// `bracketScopeConvention` also feeds `computeSectionEnd`'s and
// `preambleCutoff`'s boundary-detection — which accidentally inherited
// SELECTION's gate instead of having its own.
//
// Trigger shape: the CURRENT milestone heading is ITSELF version-bearing
// (`## [GSD.02] v2.0: Current Milestone`), so the primary version-string
// `sectionPattern` matches it directly — `headingMatches.length !== 0` from the
// very first check — and the entire bracket-resolution branch is skipped. A
// sibling milestone (PRIOR or LATER) that is version-less then gets NEITHER
// the version/emoji boundary rule (it has no version) NOR the bracket boundary
// rule (never resolved) — reproducing the exact #612 defect symptom
// (total_phases falls back to the whole-disk count) through a structural
// shape B1's own fixtures never exercised (every B1 fixture is uniformly
// version-bearing or uniformly version-less across all three milestones).

// ─── scan drops current-milestone content whenever ANY bracket-shaped ──────
// ─── heading precedes the selected milestone heading ────────────────────────
//
// The round-2 fix (39c42a89) threaded `selectedBracketId` as the REAL value
// at computeSectionEnd but as bare `null` at the preambleCutoff scan — the
// deviation's own rationale ("the selected heading's own occurrence is
// always the correct earliest answer") was right, but `null` disables the
// same-milestone check for EVERY heading, not just the selected one. Any
// bracket-shaped heading earlier than the selected milestone — same id
// (cases A, B) or a DIFFERENT id with no children of its own (case D) — was
// wrongly accepted as the earliest boundary, and the region between it and
// the real `sectionStart` was silently dropped: a completed phase vanished
// and `state sync` persisted a confident 0% where base and round-1 both
// correctly wrote 50%.
//
// Fixed with two changes, both scoped to the preambleCutoff scan only
// (computeSectionEnd is untouched — it already threads the real
// `selectedBracketId`):
//   (a) `h.offset === sectionStart` bypasses BOTH the same-milestone check
//       and the same-id-child rule below — the selected heading's own
//       position is definitionally correct, and this is the one case where
//       neither discriminator should even run (rejecting it would be
//       rejecting the heading against ITSELF).
//   (b) every OTHER bracket-shaped, non-phase-tail-shaped candidate must
//       additionally have a matching-id CHILD (the next strictly-deeper
//       heading beneath it) to count as a boundary — `bracketHeadingHasMatchingChild`.

// a non-bracket subsection before its first phase (`## [GSD.01] Setup` /
// `### Notes` / `### [GSD.01] 01: Old`) was therefore wrongly rejected as a
// boundary — its own real phase heading is TWO headings deep, not one — and

//
// CONFIRMED RED at f87bba0e before this fix (per the team lead's request to
// check observability, not just theory): the leak is NOT merely inert —
// `GSD.01-01-old`'s directory was wrongly admitted into the CURRENT
// milestone's filter via the leaked heading's qualified key
// (`GSD.01-01`), reading **3/2/67%** where truth is **2/1/50%**. Scope
// membership DOES drive the disk-side filter on this shape. Fixed by
// scanning the candidate's full SUBTREE (continue past a non-matching
// deeper heading instead of returning false immediately; only a
// same-or-shallower heading actually closes the subtree).
//
// AMENDMENT 2 — the round-3 Major 1 fix (c483552a) ported the version/emoji
// half of preambleCutoff to the token-based scan with no level cap; the raw
// `content.match(anyMilestonePattern)` it replaced was anchored `^#{1,3}\s+`.
// A level-4+ version-bearing heading in the preamble (`#### v2.0 notes`)

//
// The scope string extractCurrentMilestone returns is fence-BALANCED and
// fence-STRIPPED-by-tokenizeHeadings only when its CONSUMERS ask it that way.
// Four sites still read it (or the raw ROADMAP) with a plain regex `.exec`,
// blind to fences:
//
//   (a) roadmapPhaseCount — TWO independent copies, buildStateFrontmatter
//       (read path) and cmdStateSync (write path). A fenced EXAMPLE phase
//       heading in the preamble inflated total_phases (F10); on a
//       version-less roadmap the SAME fence-blindness compounds with (c)
//       below (F9).
//   (b) isMilestoneBounded — a raw `.test(roadmapRaw)`. A fenced-ONLY bracket
//       heading (no real section for the asserted milestone at all) wrongly
//       BOUNDED a milestone that isn't in the roadmap, un-suppressing a
//       percent that should stay suppressed (F12).
//   (c) the bracket-fallback SELECTOR (only reachable when the version-string
//       selection found nothing) — a raw `content.matchAll`. A fenced example
//       sharing the CURRENT project's own bracket id could be SELECTED as the
//       current milestone, landing `sectionStart` inside a fence (F9).
//
// Fixed by extracting ONE shared counter (countRoadmapPhaseHeadings, in
// src/state.cts, immediately above buildStateFrontmatter) used by both (a)
// copies, and converting (b) and (c) to tokenizeHeadings-based scans. The
// PRODUCER (extractCurrentMilestone's returned scope string) is deliberately
// UNCHANGED — every other consumer of that string needs its full content
// fidelity, and legacy identity forbids touching the shared string. Legacy
// (non-bracket) behavior at all four sites is byte-identical; this is the
// ONLY commit in this arc that touches SELECTION.
