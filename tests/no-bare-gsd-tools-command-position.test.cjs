// allow-test-rule: source-text-is-the-product (#2751)
'use strict';

// Regression guard for #2751: agents/*.md and gsd-core/workflows/*.md must not
// instruct an agent to invoke a BARE `gsd-tools <verb> <args>` command. The bare
// word fails with "command not found" on a shim-only install (no `gsd-tools`
// binary on PATH) — every such instruction must use the `gsd_run` resolver the
// same files already define. #725 fixed this only for the Codex install-
// conversion pipeline; the Claude-facing SOURCE shipped the bare calls verbatim
// until #2751 normalized them.
//
// A pure regex cannot perfectly distinguish an imperative ("Use `gsd-tools query
// commit` to commit") from a descriptive mention ("`gsd-tools query commit`
// returns an envelope") — both contain the same command phrase. So this guard
// scans for `gsd-tools <verb> <arg>` (the operative shape — a verb followed by
// its arguments) and subtracts a documented ALLOWLIST of known descriptive
// mentions that NAME the command without instructing literal invocation. Any
// site NOT in the allowlist is a new operative bare call and fails the gate.
//
// Verb coverage is derived LIVE from the gsd-tools host-command router
// (`gsd-core/bin/gsd-tools.cjs`) by reading the `'verb': routeHandler` / `verb:
// routeHandler` entries. This is deliberate — the original #2751 guard used a
// hand-maintained 6-verb list that silently false-passed `verify-summary` (the
// `verify` branch matched the prefix, then died on the hyphen), and missed
// `windows`, `worktree`, `smart-entry`, and `quick-tasks-append` entirely.
// Deriving the set from the router means a new verb registered there is covered
// here the moment it lands — no second list to keep in sync.
//
// Source-text guard: the deployed contract IS the markdown text the runtime
// loads. Scans FULL file text (the real hits lived in inline prose/table cells,
// not fenced bash blocks).

// Derive the verb set the bare-call guard matches against. Most top-level
// verbs live in the host-command router table as `'verb': routeHandler` entries
// (~70); this reads those dynamically so new router verbs are covered the moment
// they land. A handful of verbs are dispatched as FAMILIES (their own
// `command === 'verb'` arm, not a route-table entry): `query` (line ~2876),
// `intel`, `verify`, and `graphify`. These are stable, documented families, so
// they are supplemented explicitly here rather than parsed from the help string
// (whose prose mixes real verbs with English words like "for"/"output"/"working",
// producing noise). If a family verb is ever promoted into the route table the
// union dedupes harmlessly; if a NEW family verb is added it must be added here.
//
// Sorted longest-first so a hyphenated verb (`verify-summary`) is preferred over
