/**
 * Dimension 3b — undeclared / temporal coupling between same-wave plans (#1954).
 *
 * `gsd-plan-checker` proves plan dependencies resolve and are acyclic (Dimension 3),
 * and `/gsd:execute-phase` separately proves same-wave plans do not overlap in
 * `files_modified`. Neither axis sees coupling that is real but undeclared — plan A
 * writes a config key / table / migration / global module that plan B reads, or B
 * only works if A ran first. In parallel execution that surfaces as an intermittent
 * failure the executor cannot attribute.
 *
 * ## What this suite locks
 *
 * The deployed contract AND the wiring between the three regions of the agent doc that
 * must agree: the sub-check body, its severity rule, and the `<success_criteria>`
 * checklist. A sub-check present in the body but absent from `success_criteria` is a
 * check the agent is never told to run; the reverse is a checklist item with no rubric.
 * Neither half is observable from the other, which is why both are asserted here.
 *
 * ## What it cannot prove
 *
 * That the model acts on the text. The subject is an LLM prompt — no test in this repo
 * can prove behavior for any of the agent's twelve existing dimensions either. Stated
 * so the coverage claim is honest rather than implied.
 *
 * Patterns are CRLF-tolerant (`\r?\n`): the runtime loads the file whole, including on
 * a checkout that produced CRLF, the same case `scripts/workflow-size.cjs` defends.
