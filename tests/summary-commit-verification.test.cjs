/**
 * #3968 — commit claims must be measured, never narrated.
 *
 * Across 14 plans / 3 phases in a real project, `commits: 1` appeared in every
 * SUMMARY while `git reflog` showed ZERO git activity in the window, and
 * HANDOFF.json asserted `uncommitted_files: []` over a dirty tree — invisible
 * because nothing downstream cross-checks the narration against git. The fix
 * (maintainer decision, option c) spans three shipped surfaces; their text IS
 * the runtime-loaded contract, so shape assertions are the faithful check.

// ── #4670 — the commit-claim window is bounded to the plan's own history ─────
// `plan_head_before..HEAD` grows with every LATER plan's commits and
// execute-phase's phase-completion commit, so an honest plan flagged as
// `commit_claim_mismatch` BLOCKER as soon as anything landed after it. The
// executor now also records `plan_head_after:` (HEAD at its measurement
// moment — after the last task commit, before the SUMMARY commit), and
// verify-work reconciles against that bounded window with EXACT equality;
// legacy SUMMARYs without the anchor fall back to the WARNING path.
