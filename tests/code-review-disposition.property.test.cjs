/**
 * code-review-disposition.property.test.cjs
 *
 * RULESET.TESTS.property-based-testing — the disposition ledger is a
 * parse/transformation contract with a render/re-parse fixed point, which is
 * the textbook case for a property rather than a fixture.
 *
 * The step file states the contract in prose: "Re-running the gate preserves
 * every disposition except `open`", and it rewrites nothing when nothing
 * changed. Both are invariants over an input space that fixtures sample at a
 * handful of points — id ordering, severity mix, hand-edited source cells with
 * escaped AND bare pipes, carried rows from a review that no longer reports them.
 *
 * Four properties, all over the SHIPPED script (extracted from the step file
 * and executed), never over a model of it. The header said "two" while three
 * were running — the vocabulary property arrived without it, so the count is
 * now stated per property rather than in a lump:
 *
 *   idempotency — running the gate twice leaves the ledger byte-identical and
 *                 the second run reports `unchanged`.
 *   round-trip  — every decided disposition and its source cell survives that
 *                 second run, i.e. render → re-parse → render is the identity
 *                 on the decision.
 *   vocabulary  — a disposition outside the documented enum is coerced to
 *                 `open` rather than treated as a decision, and the `open:`
 *                 headline agrees with the rows it renders.
 *   titles      — a finding's TITLE survives the same cycle, through
 *                 JSON.stringify into the frontmatter and JSON.parse back out.
 *                 This is the contract that decides whether a reused id names
 *                 the same finding, so a lossy round-trip does not corrupt a
 *                 title — it DESTROYS a human's recorded triage, silently. The
 *                 property asserts the consequence, not the JSON.
 *
 * Every arbitrary here is built at module scope, not in a `describe` body —
 * the fast-check v4 trap that cancels a whole block.
 *
 * numRuns is lowered from the shared 200 because each case spawns the shipped
 * script twice through the process seam; the seed stays pinned, so failures
 * still reproduce. Deviating silently would be the worse trade.
