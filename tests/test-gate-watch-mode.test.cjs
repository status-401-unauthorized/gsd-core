/**
 * #1857: a GSD test gate must not hang forever on a watch-mode runner.
 *
 * Three gates were UNBOUNDED or silently-continued and are the core fix. They must:
 *   - route the resolved command through the shared `normalize-test-command`
 *     helper (defeats vitest/jest watch mode), so the paths cannot drift,
 *   - bound execution with `gsd_run run-with-timeout` using the
 *     `workflow.test_gate_timeout` budget, and
 *   - surface a timeout (exit 124) with a watch-mode hint — the regression gate
 *     ABORTS, the others surface clearly (never silently ignored).
 *
 * verify-phase's gate (a fourth, already-bounded surface) was deleted with its orphan
 * workflow in #1892; the gates above are the complete live set.
