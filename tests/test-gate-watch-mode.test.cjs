/**
 * #1857: a GSD test gate must not hang forever on a watch-mode runner.
 *
 * Three gates were UNBOUNDED or silently-continued and are the core fix. They must:
 *   - route the resolved command through the shared `normalize-test-command`
 *     helper (defeats vitest/jest watch mode), so the paths cannot drift,
 *   - bound execution with `timeout` using the `workflow.test_gate_timeout`
 *     budget, and
 *   - surface a timeout (exit 124) with a watch-mode hint — the regression gate
 *     ABORTS, the others surface clearly (never silently ignored).
 *
 * verify-phase's gate was ALREADY bounded (a fixed `timeout 300`, not a hang), so
 * it only needs the normalizer (so a watch runner exits fast) and keeps its own
 * fixed 5-minute bound — asserted separately below.
