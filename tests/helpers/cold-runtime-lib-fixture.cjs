 * ABSENT, mirroring a raw plugin-marketplace / git-clone install that never
 * ran `npm run build:lib`.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `tests/helpers/copy-script-fixture.cjs`'s
 * `copyScriptWithDeps`: that helper walks the require graph and copies every
 * dependency it finds — including gsd-core/bin/lib/*.cjs, which exist in
 * THIS repo's already-built tree — so it would faithfully reproduce a WARM
 * tree, the opposite of what a cold-tree test needs. This helper copies only
 * hooks/ and the seam module itself, and never touches gsd-core/bin/lib/ or
 * tsconfig.build.json — so `ensureRuntimeBuild()` inside the fixture
 * deterministically throws `RuntimeBuildError` ("tsconfig.build.json not
 * found") the first time any fixture hook reaches it, without ever deleting
 * or touching the real repo's gsd-core/bin/lib/.

  //
  // This is NOT a single recursive fs.cpSync(hooks/, ...) with a `filter`
  // callback. The live hooks/ directory is not stable during a test run:
  // scripts/build-hooks.js writes atomically via a per-PID staging dir
  // (hooks/.dist-staging-<pid>, gitignored — see .gitignore:21) that it
  // creates and then removes once the atomic rename into hooks/dist/ is
  // done, and up to nine test files invoke build-hooks.js concurrently from
  // their `before()` hooks. A recursive cpSync enumerates hooks/, may
  // observe another process's transient .dist-staging-<pid> entry, and can
  // then lstat/copy it AFTER that process has already deleted it — an
  // intermittent ENOENT ("no such file or directory, lstat
  // '.../hooks/.dist-staging-<pid>'"). Excluding only the basename 'dist'
  // does not help: '.dist-staging-<pid>' is a different name.
  //
  // Fix: enumerate hooks/ ourselves and skip transient entries BY NAME
  // ONLY, before ever touching them — no stat/lstat on a name we're going
  // to skip. Skipping by name (rather than filtering after readdir handed
  // control to fs.cpSync's own traversal) is what closes the race: a
  // vanishing .dist-staging-<pid> dir is never accessed at all once its
