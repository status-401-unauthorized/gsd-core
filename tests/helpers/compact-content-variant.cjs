/**
 * Shared library for the compact-content VARIANT guard (ADR-4139, epic #4139,
 * Phase 6 #4406). See `gsd-core/references/compact-content-gate.md` §"Streams
 * 1b and 4 — variant resolution" for the operational rule this module checks;
 * this file is the mechanics, not the source of truth for behavior.
 *
 * This is a DIFFERENT shape from `compact-content-split.cjs` (Phase 3, stream
 * 1's spine+detail partition). A partition is one document split into two
 * halves that must never overlap (disjointness) and whose union must equal
 * the original (completeness). A variant pair is two INDEPENDENT, complete
 * documents that are EXPECTED to overlap heavily — the compact file is a
 * hand-terser rewrite of the same content, not an extracted remainder. So
 * this module has no disjointness check and no completeness-at-split-time
 * check; it has the five checks `40-design.md` (Phase 6) describes instead:
 *
 *   1. Registration        — `discoverRegisteredVariants` (a `.compact.md`
 *      file with no canonical sibling is not a registered pair; the guard
 *      test reports it as an orphan).
 *   2. Reachability         — `checkReachability` (a registered pair whose
 *      compact path is never named by any spine's "Read ... variant
 *      resolution" call site is unwired dead weight).
 *   3. Protected content preserved — `checkProtectedContentPreserved` (a
 *      `<!-- gsd:protected -->` block's lines must appear verbatim in BOTH
 *      files, since nothing is "moved" in a variant pair — it is duplicated).
 *   4. Size smaller         — `checkSizeSmaller`.
 *   5. Template consumer parity — NOT implemented here; it needs a real
 *      artifact-generation + real-parser round trip per template, which is
 *      the domain of `tests/compact-content-template-variant-parity.test.cjs`
 *      directly, not a generic file-shape check.
 *
 * This module only reads (filesystem + a search of markdown source for
 * literal path substrings). No writes, no network, no git.
 *
 * `agents/*.compact.md` (Phase 7, #4407, ADR-4139 stream 2) is a THIRD shape
 * layered onto this module's roots: registration, protected-content and
 * size checks apply unchanged, but reachability does not — an agent variant
 * is reached by a generic, config-driven code construction in
 * `cmdAgentSkills` (`src/init.cts`), not by a literal path substring named in
 * markdown prose. `checkReachability`'s markdown-search shape has nothing to
 * find there, so callers scanning `agents/` skip it and instead assert the
 * code seam exists once (see `tests/agent-skills-compact-variant.test.cjs`).

 * walking up from the compact file itself to its nearest `gsd-core` ancestor,
 * so this works the same way against the real repo and against a fixture
 * that builds its own `<tmp>/gsd-core/...` tree):
 *
 * - The `gsd-core/<rest>` form (e.g. `gsd-core/workflows/autonomous/steps/
 *   converge-fail-fast.md`'s own convention) is unambiguous on its own — a
 *   different, longer path coincidentally ending in this exact multi-segment
 *   suffix is not a realistic false positive, so a plain substring match is
 *   sufficient without the "unprefixed" guard below.
 * - The `<rest>` form without the leading `gsd-core/` (e.g. `workflows/help/
 *   modes/full.compact.md`, `help.md`'s own dispatch-table convention) is
 *   equally unambiguous for the same reason.
 * - The bare `<stem>.compact.md` form has no such guarantee — a same-named
 *   file under an unrelated nested directory (the exact class of bug already
 *   hit once this phase: `discuss-phase/templates/context.md` vs. the root
 *   `templates/context.md`) could grant it a false reachability. This form
 *   keeps the `isUnprefixedMatch` guard from `namesFragmentAsEntryPoint`
 *   (`scripts/lint-response-language-coverage.cjs`): a path character
 *   immediately before the match means this is the tail of some longer,
 *   different path, not the fragment itself.
