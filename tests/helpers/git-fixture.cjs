/**
 * git-fixture — the shared throw-on-failure mechanism for process-seam
 * results, its non-throwing counterpart, plus a throw-preserving wrapper
 * over the seam's `runGit`.
 *
 * Why this exists: `execSync`/`execFileSync` throw on any non-zero exit,
 * and 237+ sites in this repo's test suite are written against that throw —
 * they read `err.status`, `err.stdout`, `err.stderr`. `tests/helpers/
 * process-seam.cjs` deliberately never throws (see its own header): every
 * outcome, including a non-zero exit, a timeout, or a spawn failure, comes
 * back as data on a discriminated-union result. Migrating a throwing
 * `execSync`/`execFileSync` call site straight onto the seam without this
 * wrapper would silently turn a loud test failure (an uncaught throw) into
 * a quiet one (a result object nobody checked) — exactly the kind of
 * regression a migration must not introduce.
 *
 * `throwIfFailed` is that mechanism: given any process-seam result and a
 * human-readable name for what ran, it throws in the shape the legacy
 * `execSync`/`execFileSync` idiom produced, with the seam's typed fields
 * attached alongside it — or returns quietly on a clean exit. `gitOrThrow`
 * is `throwIfFailed` specialized to `runGit`. Every other local test helper
 * that needs the same throw-on-failure bridge (over `runNode`, `runHook`,
 * etc.) calls `throwIfFailed` directly instead of hand-rolling its own copy
 * of this shape — five call sites did exactly that before this module
 * exported it, and drifted from each other in the process (#3144).
 *
 * `toLegacyResult` is the non-throwing sibling: call sites that already
 * branch on exit status as data (never wanted a throw) still need the
 * result reshaped onto the legacy `{ status, stdout, stderr }` field names
 * their assertions read — ~8 test files hand-rolled that identical mapping
 * before this module exported it too (#3147).
 *
 * `tests/helpers/process-seam.cjs` itself is NOT modified by this module —
 * its never-throws contract is intact; this is a layer on top, not a change
 * underneath.

 * against a small mkdtemp fixture repo — well over any observed local/CI
 * duration for that class of call, and far under the seam's own 60000ms
 * default so a hung git surfaces fast instead of riding out the seam's full

/**
 * Timeout for git calls that CONSTRUCT a fixture repository, in milliseconds.

 * plumbing READS (rev-parse, branch, log) against an existing repo.
 * `createFixture` (`tests/fixtures/index.cjs`) issues SIX sequential spawns to
 * build one repo — `init`, three `config` writes, `add -A`, `commit` — and
 * `init`/`commit` each write dozens of files. On Windows every one of those
 * spawns is Defender-scanned, so the construction sequence is materially
 * heavier than any single read.
 *
 * CI (PR #3323, `full test (windows-latest, 22, shard 2/3)`) recorded
 * `gitOrThrow: git init failed — outcome=timed_out exitCode=null` and the same
 * for `git commit --allow-empty`, with sibling tests in the same block taking
 * 15.6-22.0s, while every other lane — including windows-latest node 24, all
 * three shards — passed the same commit. That is a bound sized for the wrong
 * class, not a slow machine: the identical conclusion, in the identical job,
 * that `HOOK_FANOUT_TIMEOUT_MS` records for PR #3285.
 *
 * 60000ms is 4x the bound that failed and half `INSTALL_TIMEOUT_MS` — the same
 * ratio `HOOK_FANOUT_TIMEOUT_MS` uses, and the right order for a call that is
 * far heavier than a plumbing read but much lighter than a full installer run.
