/**
 * git-fixture — the shared throw-on-failure mechanism for process-seam
 * results, plus a throw-preserving wrapper over the seam's `runGit`.
 *
 * Why this exists: `execSync`/`execFileSync` throw on any non-zero exit,
 * and 237+ sites in this repo's test suite are written against that throw —
 * they read `err.status`, `err.stdout`, `err.stderr`. `tests/helpers/
 * process-seam.cjs` deliberately never throws (see its own header): every
 * outcome, including a non-zero exit, a timeout, or a spawn failure, comes
 * back as data on a discriminated-union result. Migrating a throwing
 * `execSync`/`execFileSync` call site straight onto the seam without this
 * wrapper would silently turn a loud test failure (an uncaught throw) into
 * a quiet one (a result object nobody checked) — exactly the kind of
 * regression a migration must not introduce.
 *
 * `throwIfFailed` is that mechanism: given any process-seam result and a
 * human-readable name for what ran, it throws in the shape the legacy
 * `execSync`/`execFileSync` idiom produced, with the seam's typed fields
 * attached alongside it — or returns quietly on a clean exit. `gitOrThrow`
 * is `throwIfFailed` specialized to `runGit`. Every other local test helper
 * that needs the same throw-on-failure bridge (over `runNode`, `runHook`,
 * etc.) calls `throwIfFailed` directly instead of hand-rolling its own copy
 * of this shape — five call sites did exactly that before this module
 * exported it, and drifted from each other in the process (#3144).
 * `tests/helpers/process-seam.cjs` itself is NOT modified by this module —
 * its never-throws contract is intact; this is a layer on top, not a change
 * underneath.

 * Default timeout for `gitOrThrow` calls, in milliseconds.

 * against a small mkdtemp fixture repo — well over any observed local/CI
 * duration for that class of call, and far under the seam's own 60000ms
 * default so a hung git surfaces fast instead of riding out the seam's full

 * themselves; this only decides whether to throw.
 *
 * @param {object} result - a process-seam result: `{outcome, exitCode,
 *   stdout, stderr, timedOut, signal}` (plus any seam-specific fields,

 * @param {string} displayName - human string naming what ran, e.g.

 * @throws {Error} On any non-zero exit, timeout, kill, or spawn failure.
 *   The thrown error carries, as own properties:
 *   - `status` — the exit code (the legacy `execSync`/`execFileSync` name;
 *     this repo's migrated catch blocks read `err.status`, e.g.
 *     tests/worktree-safety.test.cjs:1361, tests/read-guard.test.cjs:160,
 *     tests/security-scan.security.test.cjs:201).
 *   - `exitCode` — the same value as `status` (the seam's own name; both
 *     are aliases on purpose, not a rename).
 *   - `stdout`, `stderr` — strings.
 *   - `signal` — the seam's `signal` field.
 *   - `timedOut` — the seam's `timedOut` field.
 *   - `outcome` — the seam's `OUTCOME` discriminant.
