/**
 * Real-world I/O shell for the differential attribution check (#2723, ADR-2719).
 *
 * `emitted-diff.cjs` holds the pure conservation law; this module is the only place
 * that touches git, the filesystem, or the installer. Keeping them apart is what makes
 * the law's acceptance criteria testable in milliseconds — but the shell still has to
 * exist and actually run, or the phase ships as interface-only, which an isolated
 * reviewer correctly called out on the first cut of this work.
 *
 * ── Baseline source during the dual-run window ───────────────────────────────
 * The baseline is the emitted manifest set at `next` HEAD. During Phase 3 that is
 * available for FREE and for REAL via `git show origin/next:<fixture>` — the committed
 * golden fixtures ARE next's recorded emitted state, and CI keeps them current there.
 * No worktree, no rebuild, no 19 installer spawns for the baseline side.
 *
 * Critically this is NOT the same as reading the fixtures from the WORKING TREE: those
 * are whatever the PR author regenerated, so comparing against them would be vacuous
 * (current vs. the author's own regeneration). Reading them at `origin/next` is what
 * makes the comparison a real differential against upstream state.
 *
 * Phase 4 (#2724) deletes the fixtures, at which point `resolveBaseline`'s cache path
 * (already implemented and tested in emitted-baseline.cjs) becomes the source. That
 * swap is the only change Phase 4 needs here.
 *
 * The CURRENT side is built for real — 19 installer spawns via the same
 * `runMinimalInstall` + `buildParityManifest` the golden harness uses. It is the
 * expensive half on purpose: if a PR forgot to regenerate, current-real differs from
 * next's recorded state and the attribution actually runs, which is the whole point.

 * the baseline (built at the base ref) and the current tree (built at PR HEAD). Those
 * two legitimately differ by one family whenever a PR adds or removes a runtime, so no

 *
 * derived-vs-fixtures catches drift on a single tree; baseline-vs-current catches an
 * unexplained change to the set; and the floor catches the case neither can — a universe
 * that shrank uniformly, which a same-count self-check passes vacuously.
 *
 * Pure and IO-free by construction: the real-tree caller skips wherever no base ref
 * exists (the gsd-test runner shallow-clones, so `origin/*` is absent), which would make
 * a regression written at that altitude silently skip instead of proving anything.

 *
 * ── Why "inherit nothing" is NOT a safe default ──────────────────────────────
 * Absent at that ref is the healthy steady state and returns `null`. Every OTHER failure
 * THROWS, and the distinction is load-bearing in the direction that is easy to get
 * backwards. Returning `null` on a read error looks armed — nothing is inherited, so
 * every entry stays live — but a LIVE entry's defining power is that it CONSUMES a
 * delta. So `null` is armed on the staleness axis and DISARMED on the consumption axis,
 * which is the axis a gate over shipped artifacts actually cares about: a genuinely new,
 * unexplained ripple on a path carrying an already-merged ack would come back `acked`
 * instead of `unattributable`. That is silently the whole pre-#2789 behavior, including
 * the pre-clearing hazard this change exists to close.
 *
 * So this follows the same law as `resolveChangedPaths` above — a failed git read is an
 * ERROR, not an empty set — and matches the head-side `readAckFile`, which already
 * throws on a document that exists but will not parse. Being more forgiving about the
 * base copy of the same file would be strictly worse: it is the copy we cannot see in
 * the diff.
 *
 * `git show` alone cannot make the distinction — a bogus ref and an absent path produce
 * the same "does not exist in" message — so absence is established with `ls-tree`, which
 * exits 0 with empty output when the path is simply not there and non-zero on a real
 * fault.
 *
 * `repoPath` defaults to the legacy single file, but is generalized (#2914) so the same
 * read-at-ref logic serves any one fragment under `ACK_DIR_REPO_PATH` too — there is

/**
 * Build the baseline artifact at `ref` FOR REAL — a throwaway `git worktree` checked
 * out at `ref`, MEASURED by `cwd`'s (the calling checkout's) OWN
 * `scripts/gen-emitted-baseline.cjs` (#2724/#2767, ADR-2719 §5's "in-job build at
 * origin/next" fallback).
 *
 * ── Why the generator runs from `cwd`, not from the worktree ─────────────────────
 * `scripts/gen-emitted-baseline.cjs` was ADDED by the same PR that deleted the golden
 * fixtures this fallback used to read instead (#2724). A base ref that predates that PR
 * — which is every `next` this fallback is ever asked to measure, since the fallback
 * only runs on a cache miss for a ref that has not been through the publish job yet —
 * therefore never has the script at `<worktreeDir>/scripts/gen-emitted-baseline.cjs`,
 * and invoking it there fails closed with `Cannot find module` on every single call: the
 * fallback could never bootstrap. Running `cwd`'s copy instead, with `--dir worktreeDir`
 * telling it WHICH tree's installer to measure, isn't merely the workaround for that —
 * it is the more correct differential semantics regardless: a diff needs ONE measurement
 * schema applied to BOTH sides, or the sides stop being comparable the moment that
 * schema evolves (a new exclusion rule, a new manifest family) between the two commits.
 * Letting each side measure itself with its own, potentially different, version of the
 * script would silently reintroduce exactly that incomparability.
 *
 * This is the slow path, used only on a `resolveBaseline()` cache miss. The worktree
 * needs no `npm ci`: `bin/install.js` and the `tests/helpers/*.cjs` real-tree shells are
 * all Node-builtins-only (CONTRIBUTING.md's "No external dependencies in core"). It DOES
 * need `npm run build:lib` run there first, though — `tests/helpers/install-shared.cjs`
 * requires the TSC-COMPILED `gsd-core/bin/lib/runtime-artifact-layout.cjs`, which is
 * gitignored, not committed, and therefore absent from a bare worktree checkout, and
 * `<worktreeDir>/bin/install.js` (spawned BY `cwd`'s generator via `currentManifests`'s
 * `repoRoot` override) needs its own compiled copy alongside it, not `cwd`'s. `node_modules`
 * is symlinked in from the calling checkout (never copied — `npm ci` inside every
 * fallback build would make an already-slow path far slower) so `tsc` is available
 * without a second install; the worktree's OWN `src/*.cts` and `tsconfig.build.json`
 * are what gets compiled, so the MEASURED installer reflects `ref`, not `cwd`'s tree —
 * only the measurement CODE (the generator, install-shared.cjs, emitted-runtime.cjs)
 * comes from `cwd`.
 *
 * Every subprocess is bounded. The worktree is always removed, success or failure —
 * a leaked worktree would poison `git worktree list` for every subsequent run in the
 * same checkout (CI runners reuse the same clone across jobs in some configurations).
 *
 * @param {string} ref     the ref/sha to build at (e.g. `origin/next`, a 40-hex sha)
 * @param {object} [o]
 * @param {string} [o.cwd] repo to run `git worktree` from AND whose generator measures it
