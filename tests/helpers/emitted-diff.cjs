/**
 * Differential emitted-artifact attribution — the conservation law (ADR-2719 §1,
 * issue #2723, epic #2719 Phase 3).
 *
 * Given the emitted manifests at `next` HEAD and at PR HEAD, plus the repo paths the
 * PR actually changed, decide which moved emitted paths are EXPLAINED by the diff and
 * which are not. Unattributable deltas are a hard failure that names them; the only
 * way through is a committed acknowledgment — a per-PR fragment under
 * `tests/emitted-drift-acks/` (#2914), or, for branches predating that split, the
 * legacy single `tests/emitted-drift-ack.json` — both are read and unioned (#2914).
 *
 * ── Why this module is pure ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * No fs, no git, no installer, no clock. The naive shape — one integration test that
 * builds 19 manifests at each end and asserts — cannot practically exercise the four
 * failing-first criteria #2723 requires, so in practice they would not get written,
 * which is precisely how a phase ships promised-but-not-built. Keeping the law pure
 * makes every criterion a millisecond-scale table test, and makes the Stryker gate
 * able to bite (a 20-branch pure function is mutation-testable; a 40-minute
 * integration test is not).
 *
 * The expensive part — obtaining the manifests — lives in emitted-baseline.cjs.
 *
 * ── What this does NOT do ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It never re-derives a byte (ADR-2719 §1 is explicit that asserting
 * `emitted == transform(source)` is the tautology ADR-2264's Amendment rejected).
 * It constrains which keys may move. It also never mutates repo state: no
 * regeneration, no auto-ack. `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1` is exactly the escape hatch this
 * design removes.

 * The conservation law.
 *
 * ── Ack lifecycle: an ack is scoped to the diff that introduced it (#2789) ───
 *
 * Every other input here is BASE-RELATIVE — `baseline` vs `current`, `changedPaths` from
 * `git diff base...HEAD`. `ack` was the one ABSOLUTE input, read only from the working
 * tree, and that mismatch was a real defect: `staleAcks` asks only "did a delta consume
 * you?", which cannot tell "you never explained anything" (an authoring mistake) from
 * "your ripple is now absorbed into the base" (the ack's SUCCESS condition). Merging an
 * ack therefore made it look like a mistake, reddening `next` and every PR branching off
 * it (#2768).
 *
 * `baseAck` supplies the missing side. An entry already present at the base is SPENT: it
 * is not part of this diff, so it may no longer consume a delta and is never reported
 * stale. Making it inert is also what finally closes ADR-2719's own named hazard — a
 * leftover ack used to SILENTLY pre-clear the next ripple on its path; now that ripple
 * must be explained on its own terms. Spent entries are still reported (`spentAcks`) so
 * they can be tidied, but they gate nothing.
 *
 * `baseAck` is REQUIRED whenever `ack` is present — omitting it is an error, never a
 * silent "nothing inherited". Same discipline as `changedPaths` above: a caller that
 * cannot supply the base side must say `null` deliberately, so that dropping the
 * argument fails loudly instead of quietly restoring #2768.
