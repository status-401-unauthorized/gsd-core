/**
 * Emitted-artifact provenance table + totality guard (ADR-2719 §2, issue #2722).
 *
 * Maps every EMITTED path (a key in any tests/fixtures/golden-install-parity/*.json
 * manifest) to the REPO SOURCE path(s) whose change can legitimately explain a
 * change to it. Phase 3 (#2723) consumes this to turn "these emitted hashes moved"
 * into "…and nothing in this diff explains them".
 *
 * This module resolves provenance ONLY. It never reads a git diff, never builds a
 * manifest, and never re-derives a byte — ADR-2719 §1 is explicit that this design
 * constrains which keys may move, rather than asserting emitted == transform(source)
 * (the tautology ADR-2264's Amendment rejected).
 *
 * ── Totality ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every emitted path must match EXACTLY ONE rule. Zero matches, two matches, and
 * a rule that matches nothing are all hard failures. A hand-maintained table's
 * characteristic risk is rotting into a silent gap; totality converts that into a
 * loud one, so a new emitted family fails the build instead of passing through
 * unattributed.
 *
 * ── Derived vs. hard-coded (deliberate split) ───────────────────────────────
 * Emitted SHAPES (roots + patterns) are hard-coded on purpose. The guard's whole
 * value is failing when the installer starts emitting something new; a table that
 * derived its shapes from the installer could never fail that way — it would follow
 * the installer anywhere, silently, which is the tautology above rebuilt.
 * Source PATHS may read a first-party descriptor when the descriptor is the only
 * declaration of that source (`hostBehaviors.nativePlugin.source`). The emitted dest
 * stays hard-coded, so a dest change still fails loud.
 *
 * ── The trap this table exists to avoid ─────────────────────────────────────
 * The repo contains `skills/gsd-<stem>/SKILL.md` (71 dirs) that LOOK like the source
 * of the emitted `skills/` family. They are not: scripts/gen-plugin-skills.cjs
 * GENERATES them from commands/gsd/*.md, and the installer stages from commands/gsd/
 * directly (src/install-profiles.cts:637-708). Attributing emitted skills to repo
 * skills/ would be false attribution that still passes totality — the exact residual
 * risk ADR-2719 records. The spot-check tests pin this pair.

 * reference to each runtime's own home (`applyAgentPathRewrites`,

 * (`model_reasoning_effort`) embed — "the same config-driven precedence chain" per
 * bin/install.js's own #443 comment.
 *
 * Verified empirically (#2757), not assumed: installing every runtime for a sample
 * agent and diffing the output against the raw repo `.md` (after normalizing the
 * install-time HOME/version substitutions the golden fixtures already normalize) shows
 * NO runtime — including Claude — emits a byte-identical copy. Every one rewrites at
 * least the frontmatter and the `.claude/skills` self-reference; Claude additionally
 * gets `effort:` injected. This is why `agents-verbatim` below is `derived`, not
 * `identity`, despite its (retained, historical) id.
 *
 * Deliberately excludes `bin/install.js`: that file also implements the final splice

 * hooks, MCP config, uninstall, and every other installer concern, declaring it here
 * would be the blanket escape hatch ADR-2719 warns against — almost any PR touches SOME
 * line of it. A change localized to those two functions and not reachable through the
 * three files below stays unattributable and falls to the drift-ack file, which is the
 * documented escape hatch for exactly that case.
 *
 * ── Known follow-up, NOT included here on purpose (#2757 review) ────────────
 * The issue text also named `src/agent-tools-contract.cts` and
 * `src/agent-install-check.cts` (both touched by PR #2566, "derive Codex agent sandbox
 * from the tool"). Verified against THIS tree and excluded on the evidence:
 *   - `src/agent-tools-contract.cts` does not exist on `next` — #2566 ADDS it (+119/-0).
 *     A nonexistent path here would immediately fail the
 *     "every declared transform path exists in the repo" hygiene test in
 *     emitted-provenance.test.cjs, which exists precisely to catch a rule (or a
 *     suggested transform, as here) that cites a file that doesn't back real content.
 *   - `src/agent-install-check.cts` exists today and is READ-ONLY (`getAgentsDir`,
 *     `checkAgentsInstalled` — no fs.writeFileSync, no content transform); #2566
 *     nearly doubles it (+112/-1). Whether the addition becomes a real content-writer,
 *     a larger read-only diagnostic surface, or a helper called BY an already-declared
 *     file cannot be determined without reading #2566's actual diff, which review is
 *     explicit should not be fetched here. Declaring it on a line-count guess risks
 *     the exact false-attribution failure mode this whole table exists to prevent — a
 *     rule that looks fixed while resolving to the wrong causal story.
 * Interim safety net: if #2566 lands and either file becomes a real transform without
 * this list being updated, the differential (Phase 3) will correctly flag the moved
 * agent artifact as unattributable — that is the guard working, not a regression — and
 * unblocks via `tests/emitted-drift-ack.json` until this list is verified and extended
 * using the SAME method used for the three files above: build, install every runtime,
 * diff the output against the raw repo source, confirm which file's absence/presence
 * changes the bytes.

//                is emitted ONLY on win32 (see `hooks-built` below), so on every non-
