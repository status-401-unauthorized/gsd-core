/**
 * Shared CLASS-NORM subprocess timeouts for the test suite (#3145 pre-PR
 * review finding).
 *
 * These four values are not per-suite fixture bindings — each is a fact
 * about how long a CLASS of subprocess call takes, derived from observed
 * bench behavior. Before this module existed, all four were hand-copied
 * across dozens of files with the same justifying comment restated each
 * time (52 copies across this wave's diff alone), so the norm could drift
 * silently the next time it moved — as `INSTALL_TIMEOUT_MS` already did
 * once, from 60000 to 120000, after a real bench `ETIMEDOUT`. Import from
 * here instead of re-declaring.
 *
 * This module is for the shared norms ONLY. A call site that genuinely
 * differs from its class (e.g. a real `tsc` compile in
 * tests/ensure-runtime-build.test.cjs, or a `regen:derived` run in
 * tests/fragment-single-edit-propagation.install.test.cjs) keeps its own
 * local constant with its own justifying comment — do not force those
 * sites onto a shared value that doesn't describe them.

/**
 * A git-hook invocation that FANS OUT to nested shell subprocesses — the hook
 * itself under `bash`, plus every helper it shells to. The prepush guard is the
 * worked example: it runs a mock `git` that is also a bash script, so a single
 * `runHook` is roughly four Git Bash spawns.
 *
 * This is a heavier class than `PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS`, and the difference is
 * Windows-shaped. Each spawn there is Defender-scanned, and the first hook test
 * in a file pays cold start on top. CI (PR #3285, `full test (windows-latest,
 * 22, shard 2/3)`) recorded `outcome=timed_out exitCode=null` at exactly the
 * 15000ms probe bound while every other lane — including windows-latest node 24,
 * all three shards — passed the same commit. That is a bound sized for the wrong
 * class, not a slow machine.
 *
 * 60000ms is 4x the bound that failed and half `INSTALL_TIMEOUT_MS`, which is
 * the right order: a hook fan-out is much lighter than a full installer run but
 * far heavier than reading back a version string.
 *
 * Sites that invoke a hook doing NO subprocess fan-out should stay on
 * `PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS` — this norm describes the fan-out shape, not `runHook` in
 * general.
