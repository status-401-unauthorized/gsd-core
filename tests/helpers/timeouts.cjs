/**
 * Shared CLASS-NORM subprocess timeouts for the test suite (#3145 pre-PR
 * review finding).
 *
 * These four values are not per-suite fixture bindings — each is a fact
 * about how long a CLASS of subprocess call takes, derived from observed
 * bench behavior. Before this module existed, all four were hand-copied
 * across dozens of files with the same justifying comment restated each
 * time (52 copies across this wave's diff alone), so the norm could drift
 * silently the next time it moved — as `INSTALL_TIMEOUT_MS` already did
 * once, from 60000 to 120000, after a real bench `ETIMEDOUT`. Import from
 * here instead of re-declaring.
 *
 * This module is for the shared norms ONLY. A call site that genuinely
 * differs from its class (e.g. a real `tsc` compile in
 * tests/ensure-runtime-build.test.cjs, or a `regen:derived` run in
 * tests/fragment-single-edit-propagation.install.test.cjs) keeps its own
 * local constant with its own justifying comment — do not force those
 * sites onto a shared value that doesn't describe them.
 *
 * One exception to "bench-derived class norm": `SEAM_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS`
 * below is a structural mirror of another module's un-exported default,
 * not an independently bench-measured bound — see its own doc comment for
 * why it still belongs here (shared by ≥2 call sites) rather than as a
 * local constant.

 * `runHook` is roughly four Git Bash spawns.
 *
 * This is a heavier class than `PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS`, and the difference is
 * Windows-shaped. Each spawn there is Defender-scanned, and the first hook test
 * in a file pays cold start on top. CI (PR #3285, `full test (windows-latest,

 * class, not a slow machine.
