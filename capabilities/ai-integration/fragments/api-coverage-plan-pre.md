# API Coverage Decision Checkpoint

> Full API Coverage by Default — Opt Out, Never Opt In. Fires when a phase
> integrates an external API / SDK / service. Most non-API phases will not fire
> it — that is the point.

## Why this exists

"We integrated the API" too often silently means "we integrated whatever the
first use case exercised." Every un-built capability is then an invisible hole,
discovered later by a user who reasonably expected it to work. The phase sealed
green because its tasks completed; nobody decided the gaps were acceptable,
because nobody enumerated them. This checkpoint makes the surface **visible and
decided** before the phase can seal.

## Detect whether this phase integrates an external API

The detector is a deterministic scan over the phase scope. It strips fenced
code blocks first, so a trigger term inside a code snippet does not fire. It
returns a typed result: `{ detected, signals[], terms }`. Run it on the phase
scope (the concatenation of this phase's ROADMAP section + the PLAN body):

```bash
SCOPE="$(cat "${PHASE_DIR}"/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null) $(gsd_run query roadmap.get-phase "${PHASE}" 2>/dev/null || true)"
API_COVERAGE_JSON=$(printf '%s' "$SCOPE" | node gsd-core/bin/lib/api-coverage.cjs --json 2>/dev/null || echo '{"detected":false,"signals":[]}')
```

Read `API_COVERAGE_JSON.detected`. Act on it only — do **not** pattern-match the
prose yourself.

**If `detected` is `false`:** this phase does not integrate an external API. Skip
the checkpoint entirely and continue planning. Do not raise it with the user.

**If `detected` is `true`:** an external-API integration is in scope. You MUST
produce a **coverage matrix** before the plan is finalized.

## Produce the coverage matrix

Enumerate the external API's full **capability surface** — the verb/endpoint/method
list (e.g. for a music service: `search`, `play`, `pause`, `skip`, `set_volume`,
`get_playlist`, `create_playlist`, `add_to_playlist`, …). For each capability
record a decision, starting from **full coverage** as the default:

| capability | decision | reason |
|---|---|---|
| `<capability-id>` | `INTEGRATE` \| `OPT-OUT` | `<one-line reason if OPT-OUT>` |

Rules:

- **`INTEGRATE` is the default.** Every capability starts as INTEGRATE; the
  matrix is the *subtraction record*.
- **Every `OPT-OUT` MUST carry a one-line reason** (`not needed`, `not needed
  yet`, `explicitly out of scope`, …). An opt-out without a reason is an
  un-decided hole — the exact failure mode this gate exists to close.
- **A second integration against the same need** (e.g. a second platform for the
  same capability) starts from the **same full-coverage baseline** as the first.
  Do not carry over the first integration's opt-outs silently — re-decide each
  capability for the new surface, so a first-class/fallback asymmetry cannot
  accumulate.

Write the matrix to `${PHASE_DIR}/COVERAGE.md` (canonical markdown-table form):

```markdown
# API Coverage — <service>

> Full coverage by default. Opt-outs are explicit, reasoned decisions.

| capability | decision | reason |
|---|---|---|
| search | INTEGRATE | |
| playlists | INTEGRATE | |
| skip | OPT-OUT | not needed yet — tracked for follow-up phase |
```

A fenced ` ```coverage ` JSON block is also accepted for machine-generated
matrices; the markdown table is preferred (human-editable, diff-friendly).

## The seal-time gate

This checkpoint is enforced. At `verify:pre` the `api-coverage.verify-pre` gate
runs `check api-coverage.verify-pre <phase-dir>`:

- If `COVERAGE.md` exists, it is validated — every row needs a valid decision and
  every `OPT-OUT` a reason. A malformed/partial matrix **blocks the seal**.
- If `COVERAGE.md` is absent, the detector runs again over the phase scope. If a
  strong external-API-integration signal is found, the seal is **blocked** until a
  matrix is produced. If no signal is found, the phase is treated as a non-API
  phase and the seal proceeds.

So: an API-integrating phase cannot seal without a decided matrix. Produce it at
plan time; do not leave it for seal time.

## Tuning the vocabulary (optional)

The trigger vocabulary is a curated, additive-only set in
`gsd-core/bin/lib/api-coverage.cjs` (`DEFAULT_API_COVERAGE_TERMS`). To widen it
for a project, override at the call site:

```bash
printf '%s' "$SCOPE" | node gsd-core/bin/lib/api-coverage.cjs --json \
  --verbs integrate,wrap,connect,embed --nouns api,sdk,rest,grpc,webhook,plugin
```

The whole checkpoint is toggleable via `workflow.api_coverage_gate` in
`.planning/config.json`.
