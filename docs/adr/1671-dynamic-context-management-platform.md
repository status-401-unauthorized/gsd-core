# ADR-1671: Dynamic context management platform

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-06-24
- **Extends:** ADR-0002 (Command Contract Validation Module), ADR-457 (build-at-publish generation model for `bin/lib/*.cjs`)
- **Relates:** ADR-857 §7 (Connected-Capability / MCP contract — kept deferred by this ADR)

## Context

GSD ships command and workflow content as large, hand-edited Markdown files. Two structural problems compound:

1. **Authoring is monolithic.** A single workflow body carries every branch inline. `gsd-core/workflows/plan-phase.md` is 93,973 bytes / 1,770 lines; `execute-phase.md` is 93,426 bytes. Mutually-exclusive paths (`--prd`, `--ingest`, `--mvp`, `--reviews`) all live in the same file, so a runtime loads guidance for branches a given invocation will never take.

2. **One payload ships to every runtime.** Install copies the whole `gsd-core/` tree (3.4 MB, 89 workflows, 1.7 MB) **byte-identical to all 15 runtimes** via `copyWithPathReplacement` (`bin/install.js`). The only per-runtime work is string rewrites and description truncation. There is **no per-runtime trimming or splitting**.

The result is constant pressure against size caps, enforced today only against *source* files (not emitted output) by a two-part guard (issue #1074): a per-file baseline ratchet plus per-tier hard caps (workflows XL 96 KiB / LARGE 60 KiB / DEFAULT 40 KiB; agents XL 56 KiB / LARGE 48 KiB / DEFAULT 24 KiB). Several files have almost no headroom — `agents/gsd-verifier.md` has **293 bytes**. The one true emission-time cap, Windsurf's 12,000-byte limit (`src/runtime-artifact-conversion.cts`), is a hard `throw` with no graceful fallback. Adding one rule to a tight file forces an extract-to-`references/` refactor (`DEFECT.AGENT-FILE-SIZE-CAP-BREACH`), turning a one-line edit into a multi-file change that ripples across stub frontmatter, the workflow body, reference fragments, and `docs/` — each guarded by a different lint.

A separate but related pain: the repo-root `CONTEXT.md` predicate fact-store (~935 lines, ~200 KB of `CLASS.subkey=value` predicates that agent briefs are required to "cite verbatim") has **no programmatic reader, validator, or selector**. Briefs are hand-assembled, and `META.RULE.brief-must-cite-doc` is enforced only socially — paraphrasing from memory has caused real violations (5/8 agents in one documented batch).

### The machinery already exists, in silos

Research into the codebase found that most JIT primitives are already present and proven; they are just single-purpose and not composed:

- **Lazy reference loading** — the init bundle. `gsd_run query init.<cmd>` (`src/init.cts`) returns JSON of *paths + flags, not contents*; the model reads only the files it needs ("paths only to minimize orchestrator context", `plan-phase.md:66`). This is Anthropic's recommended "lightweight identifiers over payloads" pattern, in production.
- **Progressive disclosure** — `gsd-core/workflows/help.md` reads only the one mode file matching the argument (`brief` 0.9 KB / `default` 1.9 KB / `full` 34 KB).
- **Token-budgeted assembly** — `src/prompt-budget.cts` `applyBudget()` already does priority-ordered, budget-trimmed composition with an omission note — but it is walled into the cross-AI review pipeline only.
- **Pointer-passing channel** — `src/io.cts` spills any payload > 50 KB to a tmpfile and returns `@file:<path>`.
- **A codegen factory + drift-guard harness** — 13 generators share one `--check`/`--write` idiom (derive fresh, diff committed, exit 1 on drift). `scripts/gen-plugin-skills.cjs` already generates 69 shipped `SKILL.md` files from `commands/gsd/*.md`.
- **A reusable structured-markdown parser** — `src/markdown-sectionizer.cts`, already powering the per-phase `<decisions>` fact-store reader (`src/decisions.cts`).

### External practice

The closest external analogs are Anthropic Agent Skills' three-tier progressive disclosure (metadata → `SKILL.md` → bundled references), MCP resources/prompts/deferred-tools (list-then-fetch JIT), and priority/token-budget prompt renderers (Priompt, VS Code `@vscode/prompt-tsx`) that include the highest-priority fragments that fit a budget via a binary-search cutoff, with `flexReserve` floors for load-bearing content and `<isolate>` for a stable cacheable prefix. The portability catch is real and load-bearing: only the Skills *format* (directory + `SKILL.md` + frontmatter) is an open standard; native lazy loading is Claude-specific, and GSD's 15 runtimes do not all support skills or MCP (cf. surface-mismatch bugs #1614 antigravity, #1615 windsurf).

## Decision

Adopt a **dynamic context management platform** built on a hybrid of build-time and run-time assembly, reusing the existing seams rather than inventing new infrastructure:

1. **Fragment store (authoring model).** Author workflow content as composable, priority-tagged fragments (workflow sections + shared `references/` + predicate-derived blocks), each carrying an applicability condition (which flags / capabilities / runtimes require it). This is the net-new authoring discipline.

2. **Build-time composer + per-runtime budget emission (the universal floor).** Generalize `prompt-budget.cts` out of the review silo into a shared `context-composer` seam (`src/*.cts` → `build:lib` → `bin/lib/*.cjs`). At build/install time, for each command × runtime, the composer selects the needed fragments and trims by priority to fit that runtime's measured cap (`scripts/workflow-size.cjs` `lfByteCount`), emitting a right-sized artifact through the existing converter. Caps move from *source* to *emitted output*; the Windsurf 12 KB `throw` becomes a graceful auto-trim/auto-extract — noting that this `throw` is currently **duplicated byte-identically in two surfaces**, `bin/install.js:2796-2797` and `src/runtime-artifact-conversion.cts:1116-1117`, so the change must land in both or they drift. This is what makes caps stop biting on non-lazy runtimes, and it requires no runtime feature — so it is the universal floor.

3. **Progressive disclosure where the host supports it.** On lazy-loading hosts (Claude Code and the Agent SDK), keep the stub + `@-ref` model and let the init bundle name exactly which files to read; the body and references load on demand.

4. **Run-time selection via the init seam (per-request precision).** Extend the init bundle / `command-routing-hub` dispatch (`src/command-routing-hub.cts`) to emit a typed manifest of which sections / references / predicates a *specific* invocation needs (given parsed args, flags, phase state, active capabilities), reusing the `@file:` spill channel for assembled fragments. This is layered on top of the fragment store.

5. **Formalize the `CONTEXT.md` predicate fact-store → JIT selector.** Give the predicate grammar a parser (on `markdown-sectionizer`), an ID-uniqueness validator, a `--check`/`--write` drift-guard, and a `task → relevant predicate set` selector. This converts hand-assembled briefs into JIT-generated context and attacks the maintainer-side "edit a 200 KB file by hand" pain directly. **This is sequenced first** (see Prototype) because it is the smallest, lowest-risk piece that proves the whole pattern.

6. **Defer MCP (Connected-Capability).** Per ADR-857 §7 / #956, a served MCP catalog (resources/prompts/deferred-tools) remains an additive future enhancement for MCP-capable runtimes — never a replacement for the file-copy floor. Not in scope here.

### Options considered

| Option | Summary | Fixes caps? | Runtime compat | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A. Progressive-disclosure authoring | Metadata-first files + one-level references; lean on host lazy-load | Partial; needs host lazy-load | Authoring universal; native JIT Claude-first | Adopt as a layer |
| B. Build-time composer + per-runtime budget emission | Composer trims fragments to each runtime cap, emits right-sized files | Yes — measured before write | Universal floor | **Adopt as core** |
| C. Run-time selection via init seam | Init bundle names which slices this invocation needs | Reduces per-invocation context | Broad (the `gsd_run` shim is universal) | Adopt after B |
| D. MCP served catalog | Serve content as resources/prompts/deferred-tools | For MCP hosts only | Partial; needs 2nd channel | Defer (ADR-857 §7) |
| E. Predicate fact-store → JIT selector | Parse/validate/select `CONTEXT.md` predicates | Maintainer-side big-file pain | N/A (build + orchestrator) | **Adopt first** |

Pure Agent Skills (A alone) and pure MCP (D alone) were rejected as the foundation because both are runtime-partial; only build-time emission (B) relieves caps on every runtime.

## Architecture and contracts

- **Fragment unit (open question, see below):** either separate files (clean lazy-load + INVENTORY rows) or in-file section markers (`<!-- gsd:section ... -->`, mirroring the existing `<!-- gsd:loop-host -->` markers consumed by `scripts/gen-loop-host-contract.cjs`).
- **Composer contract:** an ordered list of fragments, each carrying a *shrink strategy*; the closed set is `verbatim`, `head-shrink`, `proportional-truncate` (with a per-fragment floor), and `drop`. `flexReserve`-style floors for load-bearing fragments (`META.RULE` citation rules, contribution gates, closing-keyword rules) generalize the existing per-plan 1024-byte floor. A byte-stable canonical prefix (`<isolate>`) is kept identical across runtimes to preserve KV-cache warmth and keep launcher-parity tests green.

  **Amended by #2929 (Phase 2).** This ADR originally specified the contract as "priority + binary-search cutoff to a per-runtime budget". Implementing Phase 2 established that a cutoff alone **cannot express the function this platform generalizes**: `prompt-budget.applyBudget` is not a cutoff but a fixed five-step ladder in which each section carries its own shrink strategy, and only three of its eight sections are ever droppable — `PROJECT.md` is head-shrunk to N lines and plans are proportionally tail-truncated with a per-plan floor, while instructions and roadmap are never trimmed at all. A cutoff composer sorts by priority and discards the tail; it has no way to say "shrink this one", "truncate that one but never below its floor", or "these three are the only droppables, in this order". Building to the literal wording and routing `prompt-budget` through it would have silently changed review-prompt output. Shrink strategies are therefore the core abstraction, and **binary-search cutoff becomes one strategy among them** — the right one for per-runtime emission in Phases 3-4, not for this ladder. Ordering is declaration order rather than a numeric priority field. This is an elaboration of the decision's intent, not a reversal of it.
- **Applicability grammar (added by #2930, Phase 3).** The fragment unit's `when=` attribute is deliberately a CLOSED grammar: exactly one atom from a frozen vocabulary — `always`, `flag:--wave`, `state:gap-closure-phase`, `state:has-prior-phases` — with no boolean operators, negation, or nesting, and an unknown `when=` value throws rather than being ignored. This is a Greenspun's-Tenth-Rule guard: left open-ended, `when=` acquires `&&`/`!`/precedence/runtime-capability predicates and becomes an ad-hoc, informally-specified predicate language grown one condition at a time. Widening the vocabulary requires a coordinated ADR amendment, not an organic edit. `when=` is parsed and validated in Phase 3 but not yet acted on; applicability selection is Phase 5.
- **Budget unit:** bytes for emission caps (matches `lfByteCount`, deterministic, offline-safe); a token estimate for run-time selection.
- **Determinism + drift-guard:** every generated artifact follows the universal `--check`/`--write` idiom and is committed; any constant shared between two surfaces gets a `DEFECT.GENERATIVE-FIX` parity assertion. Caps are asserted on **emitted per-runtime bytes** via real spawn-install tests (engine-direct tests are false-green for install behavior).
- **Boundary coverage:** the composer's budget logic is tested at `cap-1 / cap / cap+1` per `RULESET.TESTS.boundary-coverage`.

## Migration path

Sequenced to de-risk — prove the pattern on the smallest surface first, scale last:

1. **This ADR** establishes the platform, the fragment/composer contract, emission-time caps, and the drift-guard requirement.
2. **Prototype the predicate fact-store (Option E)** — *landed with this ADR as a non-shipping reference example* under `examples/dynamic-context-management/` (see Prototype below).
3. **Lift `prompt-budget.cts`** out of the review silo into a shared `context-composer` seam with fast-check property tests + boundary coverage.
4. **Pilot fragmentization on one XL workflow** (`plan-phase.md` or `execute-phase.md`): split into priority-tagged sections + applicability; composer emits per-runtime; prove byte-identical-or-smaller output and green `gsd-test` docker.
5. **Move caps from source to emitted output**; turn the Windsurf `throw` into graceful auto-trim; auto-regenerate size baselines on intentional edits.
6. **Wire the init bundle (C)** to emit a per-invocation sections manifest; workflows consume it.
7. **Roll out across LARGE/XL tiers**; update INVENTORY families + parity tests.
8. **(Deferred)** MCP served catalog (ADR-857 §7 / #956).

**Ordering landmine:** any generator consuming compiled output must run *after* `build:lib` (tsc), like `gen-plugin-skills` / `gen-capability-registry`; regenerating before `build:lib` silently drops unbuilt modules (`gsd-inventory-manifest-regen-needs-build`).

## Consequences

**Positive**
- Caps stop biting: each runtime's emitted artifact is measured and trimmed before write.
- A discovered fact lands in one fragment / predicate, not 4 hand-edited surfaces.
- Reuses the existing converter, drift-guard, boundary-test, and `markdown-sectionizer` infrastructure — the net-new pieces are only the fragment model and the composer.
- Opens a path to collapse the 10+ hand-written per-runtime body converters toward a data-driven spec.

**Negative / risks**
- Trimming a load-bearing fragment is a correctness hazard (history: paraphrased `META.RULE` → agent violations). Mitigate with `flexReserve` floors, a Promptfoo-style eval gate, and boundary tests.
- Per-runtime emission multiplies artifacts across the 15 × N matrix (inventory/parity surface).
- Build-order fragility (must run after `build:lib`).
- Dual-surface drift if any future MCP channel is added — requires parity assertions.

## Prototype (step 2, Option E) — non-shipping reference example

A working prototype proves the platform pattern end-to-end. It ships as a **reference example only**, under `examples/dynamic-context-management/` — deliberately outside the build (`src/` → `bin/lib/`), the npm package `files[]`, the installer, and the CI test suite (`tests/`). Nothing in it is compiled into or installed with GSD; the production implementation lands in a later phase.

- `examples/dynamic-context-management/context-predicates.cjs` — pure parser/selector: `parsePredicates(markdown)` (handles bare and list-item backtick predicate forms, splits on first `=`, skips fenced code / blockquote prose, detects duplicate IDs), `selectPredicates(predicates, {klass, prefix, contains})` (the JIT "task → predicate set" selector), and `buildIndex(predicates)` (deterministic, sorted).
- `examples/dynamic-context-management/gen-context-index.cjs` — self-contained CLI with `--check`/`--write` drift-guard plus a `--select <query>` mode demonstrating JIT brief assembly.
- `examples/dynamic-context-management/CONTEXT-INDEX.json` — sample generated index: **415 predicates, 20 classes** (verified 2026-07-31; down from 416 after #2928/PR #2938 reconciled the last duplicate predicate ID, `RULESET.WORKFLOW_MARKDOWN.FENCES`). Originally committed as **393 predicates, 18 classes** (2026-06-24); `CONTEXT.md` has since gained the `PROBE` (11) and `PROHIB` (10) classes, with `DEFECT` 161→167 and `RULESET` 59→56→55. The committed artifact had gone stale (`--check` exited 1) and was regenerated with `--write`.
- `examples/dynamic-context-management/demo.cjs` + `README.md` — runnable usage example and notes.

During research the slice was validated with 42 behavioral tests (predicate forms, fenced-code / prose skipping, duplicate-id detection, the selector, a deterministic index, and a fast-check property test); those landed as CI tests under `tests/` with the production implementation (#2928/PR #2938).

The prototype immediately surfaced **3 latent duplicate predicate IDs** in `CONTEXT.md` (`RULESET.WORKFLOW_MARKDOWN.FENCES`, `RULESET.GEMINI.TOOLS.ask_user`, `RULESET.GEMINI.TEST_SENTINEL`) — integrity drift no existing tool catches.

**Re-checked 2026-07-31:** the two `RULESET.GEMINI.*` duplicates were removed along with the Gemini runtime, not reconciled deliberately; the remaining `RULESET.WORKFLOW_MARKDOWN.FENCES` duplicate was reconciled deliberately in #2928/PR #2938, which also productionized `--check` into CI so it now fails closed on any *new* duplicate ID.

**Phase 0 acceptance status (2026-07-31).** The epic's Phase 0 criterion — "`gen-context-index --check` green in CI" — was **unmet**: `--check` exited 1 against `next`, and no CI job failed, because the example sits deliberately outside `tests/` — the red was invisible to the pipeline. The index has now been regenerated and `--check` exits 0.

That is a point-in-time true-up, not a fix. Per Open question 4, the index is keyed on baked `line` numbers, so it will re-drift on the next `CONTEXT.md` line shift. The criterion stays fragile until the keying changes — and it stays *silently* fragile for as long as the drift-guard remains outside CI.

Prototype scope notes: the parser is intentionally self-contained for the example; production should consume the compiled `markdown-sectionizer` seam, live under `src/` → `bin/lib/`, and be drift-guarded by a generator wired into the build **after** `build:lib`.

**Done (#2928).** Production landed under `src/context-predicates.cts` → `gsd-core/bin/lib/context-predicates.cjs` (ADR-457 build-at-publish). Fence-aware line skipping mirrors `markdown-sectionizer.cts`'s exported `scanFencedBlocks` delimiter-matching rule exactly (byte-for-behavior parity proven by a dedicated test suite) via a LOCAL, interleaved single pass, rather than a call into that seam directly: a two-pass design (mask comments, then call `scanFencedBlocks`, or the reverse) cannot correctly resolve mutual precedence between HTML comments and fences in both directions — a fence delimiter inside a real comment (with no later real closer) was found to falsely skip the rest of the file to EOF, and the converse ordering falsely let a comment token inside a real fence leak past the fence's own close — so the two constructs are scanned together, each suppressing the other's open/close detection while active (post-#2928-review fix; see `src/context-predicates.cts`'s module doc comment). `scripts/gen-context-index.cjs --check`/`--write` is wired into `lint:generated-sync` (so `lint:ci`, CI-gated) and into `build` (after `build:lib`) and `regen:derived`; the selector is exposed live via `gsd-tools query context-predicates --class|--prefix|--contains`.

## Open questions

1. Fragment unit: separate files vs in-file section markers?
2. Build-time emission vs run-time assembly as the primary surface during migration (double-write vs per-workflow cutover)?
3. Whether/when to invest in per-runtime native channels (skills, MCP) above the universal file floor.

**Resolved by #2928 — index keying: stable IDs, with no `line` field at all.** Question 4 asked stable IDs vs baked `line` numbers: `CONTEXT-INDEX.json` stored each predicate's `line`, so `--check` re-drifted on *any* `CONTEXT.md` line shift — a typo fix three sections up failed the gate. Raised by @davesienkowski (#1671, 2026-06-25). The shipped resolution is **stronger than the option originally proposed** (keying the comparison on stable IDs with `line` retained as non-compared metadata): the committed `ContextIndex.predicates` entries carry **no `line` field at all**. Committed-but-uncompared metadata goes silently stale — the same defect class the drift-guard exists to catch, with the alarm removed — so it was dropped from the committed artifact rather than merely excluded from the comparison. `line` is still returned by the live `parsePredicates`/`gsd-tools query context-predicates` result for callers that want to cite a source location; only the committed `docs/CONTEXT-INDEX.json` shape omits it.

**Resolved by other work — not carried as open.** A fourth question was proposed in review (#1671, 2026-06-25): *what populates the eval-gate assertion set, and is it graded exogenously?* Since that review, the answer has landed as first-class predicate classes rather than remaining a design gap: `PROBE.principle` (`verifier-reach-equals-spec-reach`), `PROBE.family` (edge-probe + prohibition-probe + ui-consideration-probe), `PROBE.protocol` (recall → precision), and `PROHIB.judgment-tier` (exogenous grading) — see ADR-550 D4/D7 and ADR-1606. The `PROHIB.*` predicates live in the same `CONTEXT.md` store this ADR formalizes, which is the single-store property that review asked for.

**Resolved by #2930 (Phase 3) — fragment unit: in-file `<!-- gsd:section id= when= -->` markers.** Question 1 asked separate files vs in-file section markers. Confirmed with the maintainer: separate files are eliminated by this phase's own acceptance criterion — "emitted output byte-identical-or-smaller" — because splitting a workflow into files changes the emitted tree's *shape*, which is neither identical nor smaller, it is different; it also multiplies INVENTORY rows and `@`-ref contract surface for no Phase-3 benefit. A sidecar fragment manifest keyed on heading anchors was also rejected: zero source growth, but it creates a second surface that drifts from the workflow — the exact multi-surface edit pain the epic exists to remove (`DEFECT.GENERATIVE-FIX`), and directly against the epic's "one fragment, not 4 surfaces" thesis. The shipped answer is in-file markers, stripped at emit so the installed artifact carries no build metadata and shrinks; markers are self-anchoring (no line-number keying — Open question 4 already rejected that for the predicate index, and the same reasoning applies here), and the existing `<!-- gsd:loop-host … -->` block at `plan-phase.md:1` is in-repo precedent for the form. Production landed under `src/workflow-fragments.cts` → `gsd-core/bin/lib/workflow-fragments.cjs` (ADR-457 build-at-publish), piloted on `execute-phase.md`. **The pilot was retargeted from `plan-phase.md` mid-phase, and the reason is itself the most important finding here.** The branches the epic names as motivating (`--prd`, `--ingest`, `--mvp`, `--reviews`) all live in `plan-phase.md` — but `plan-phase.md` sits only 36 B under an independent, pre-existing size gate (`tests/phase6-capstone-conformance.test.cjs`'s `PRE_PHASE6`, an ADR-857 Phase-6 completion property that this ADR's own Blast-radius analysis did not enumerate against, catching only the XL cap). It cannot absorb even the smallest marker overhead, so **it could not be fragmentized at all under this phase's grammar**, independent of any shape limitation. The pilot instead proves the mechanism on state- and flag-gated `<step>` blocks in `execute-phase.md` (`partial-wave`/`flag:--wave`, `gap-closure-artifacts`/`state:gap-closure-phase`, `regression-gate`/`state:has-prior-phases`), which has 728 B of real headroom under its own `PRE_PHASE6` gate. This is direct evidence for the epic's premise that fragmentization pays off, but it also means **Phase 4 (moving size caps from source bytes to emitted bytes) may need to land before `plan-phase.md` itself can be fragmentized.** Separately, and independent of the size-gate finding: the marker grammar addresses SECTION-shaped branches only — a whole-line, non-nesting comment pair around a contiguous block — and `--mvp`'s content in `plan-phase.md` is INTERLEAVED rather than sectioned (`MVP_MODE` resolution shares a bash block with `--tdd`/`--no-tracer`/`--no-reversibility-gates` at `plan-phase.md:125-158`, and is inline `${MVP_MODE === 'true' ? ... }` template interpolation at `:794-803`), so `--mvp` would remain unmarkable by this grammar even if the size gate allowed it. Phase 6 must either accept that gap or introduce a finer-grained (sub-line) mechanism for interleaved branches.

**Resolved by #2930 (Phase 3) — build-time emission is the primary surface; per-workflow cutover, no double-write.** Question 2 asked build-time emission vs run-time assembly as the primary surface during migration, and whether that requires a double-write period. Because markers are stripped at emit, an unmarked workflow parses to exactly one implicit fragment and composes back byte-identical by construction — that structural guarantee is what makes a per-workflow cutover safe file-by-file, with no double-write period and no flag day: a workflow can gain markers on its own schedule without touching any other workflow's emission path. Phase 5's run-time selection is planned to consume a build-derived manifest, not markers read at run time, keeping the run-time surface decoupled from the authoring surface.
