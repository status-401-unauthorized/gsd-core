# ADR-3574: Install materialization shares primitives, not one writer

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-16
- **Issue:** [#3574](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/3574)
- **Epic:** [#2866](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/2866) — Phase 6 ([#2875](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/2875))
- **Amends:** none. Constrained by [ADR-58](58-runtime-install-policy-module.md), [ADR-3660](3660-runtime-artifact-layout-module.md), [ADR-1508](1508-runtime-artifact-conversion-module.md).

## Context

Epic #2866 Phase 6 was scoped on the premise that *"materialize this layout"* is implemented three
times and skipped once, and that the remedy is to extract the
preserve → prune → stage → copy → restore choreography into **one** module with the three sites
becoming callers.

That premise was measured against the tree on 2026-08-16, after Phase 5 ([#2874](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/2874))
landed. **It does not hold.** The three sites overlap in *shape* and diverge in *mechanism*:

| step | `installRuntimeArtifacts`<br>`src/install-engine.cts:770-958` | `applySurface`<br>`src/surface.cts:359-452` | agent loop<br>`bin/install.js:11120+` |
|---|---|---|---|
| preserve | snapshot-based, **`skills` kind only** (`_snapshotDir`) | **none** | none |
| prune | `_removeGsdEntries`, prefix-scoped wipe | `pruneSkillDirs` — **allow-list, never wipes** | stale `gsd-*` unlink |
| stage | copies straight into `dest` | **temp dir first**, then syncs | inline transform, no staging dir |
| restore | `_restoreDir` the snapshot | none | none |

The divergence is deliberate on at least one side. `applySurface`'s prune is allow-list precisely
so that it *structurally cannot* delete a user's files — its own doc comment ties that to the
#2973/#3664 user-directory-preserving fix. `installRuntimeArtifacts` instead wipes a prefix-scoped
set and restores a snapshot of the one user-owned directory it knows about.

A single writer must pick one of these. Forcing `applySurface` onto snapshot-restore would replace
a design that *cannot* lose user files with one that deletes them and puts them back — trading a
structural guarantee for a procedural one. Forcing `installRuntimeArtifacts` onto temp-staging adds
a staging hop it does not need.

Two further premises of the original scoping are stale:

- **The `agents` bypass is shrinking, not static.** `_DESCRIPTOR_AGENTS_RUNTIMES`
  (`bin/install.js:11152`) already routes ten runtimes — cursor, windsurf, augment, trae, codebuddy,
  copilot, antigravity, qwen, kimi, zcode — through the descriptor. The inline `_hostBehaviors()`
  dispatch survives only for codex, cline, hermes and generic runtimes.
- **The duplication comment is stale in the opposite direction.** It lives at
  `src/runtime-artifact-layout.cts:277-297` (not the range #2875 cites) and reads: *"That
  duplication is deliberate until the second `layout.kinds` consumer — `applySurface` … — mirrors
  the legacy agent pipeline."* That condition has **partly** been met, via `agentCtx` /
  `stageAgentsForRuntimeWithConverter` in `applySurface`.

Separately and independently, **#1874-F19 is confirmed real**: `preserveUserArtifacts`
(`src/install-engine.cts:168-179`) builds an in-memory `Map<string,string>` via `readFileSync`, and
`restoreUserArtifacts` (`:187-195`) writes it back. Nothing touches disk in between. Any process
death between the intervening wipe and the restore loses the content outright, at four call sites
(`install-engine.cts:633`, `:705`; `bin/install.js:8658`, `:11056`).

## Decision

### 1. There will be no single materializer module

The three choreographies stay distinct. This ADR explicitly declines Phase 6's first acceptance
criterion as written — *"One module writes a `Layout`; the three former call sites delegate to it"* —
because satisfying it requires breaking one of two mechanisms that are each correct for their own
caller.

Recording the refusal is the point: the next reader who notices three similar-looking loops should
find this file rather than re-derive the extraction and rediscover the conflict.

### 2. What IS extracted: durable user-artifact staging (F19)

`preserveUserArtifacts` / `restoreUserArtifacts` move to a shared module and stage to a **durable
on-disk path before any wipe**, reusing `copyPreservingSymlink`
(`src/installer-migrations.cts:166-177`) — a pure two-argument function with no migration-specific
state, already used by the `backup-and-remove` migration action in exactly this
copy-strictly-before-delete order.

`copyPreservingSymlink` is the correct primitive for a second reason beyond durability: it never
dereferences a symlink target. Its own doc comment records why — dereferencing could copy the bytes
behind a link like `~/.ssh/id_rsa` into the backup tree. A hand-rolled `copyFileSync` here would
reintroduce that.

The journal / `backupRoot` / `runId` scaffolding around it is migration-specific and is **not**
extracted. Only the primitive is shared.

### 3. What IS extracted: the retired-kind prune

`pruneRetiredRuntimeArtifacts` is already called by both `installRuntimeArtifacts` and
`applySurface` with the same intent. That is genuine shared behavior rather than parallel
evolution, and it is the one step where a single owner costs nothing.

### 4. The `agents` bypass is closed on its own terms

Removing the inline `_hostBehaviors()` agent dispatch so the descriptor is authoritative for every
runtime is **independent of the prune question** and proceeds regardless. It is the part of Phase 6
whose evidence survived scrutiny intact, and ten runtimes have already made the trip.

### 5. Placement and content ownership are unchanged

Per [ADR-3660](3660-runtime-artifact-layout-module.md), placement knowledge outside
`runtime-artifact-layout` is drift; the extracted primitives consume `Layout`, never re-derive it.
Per [ADR-1508](1508-runtime-artifact-conversion-module.md), *"Layout owns placement; this module
owns content"*, and the conversion module imports nothing upward. The primitives sit **downstream**
of both and introduce no upward dependency.

Per [ADR-58](58-runtime-install-policy-module.md), these primitives are on the **adapter** side of
the pure-policy/thin-adapter split — they execute IO. Phase 5 routed that IO through an injectable
seam and established that the write-confinement *decisions* (`hasExistingSymlinkBetween`,
`assertDestWithinConfigHome`) stay outside the adapter, so a fake cannot certify an install the real
filesystem would refuse. **The extraction must not relocate those decisions.**

## What this ADR does not decide

- **Whether the three choreographies ever unify.** The `applySurface` descriptor-agents migration is
  partly landed; when it completes, the shapes may converge enough that the question is worth
  reopening on evidence. Revisit then, not before — and not by re-deriving the extraction this file
  declines.
- **The prune model itself.** Whether allow-list or prefix-scoped-wipe is the better default across
  the installer is a real question and a separate one. Nothing here endorses either as canonical.
- **`USER_OWNED_ARTIFACTS`' membership.** #2875 names `USER-PROFILE.md` as at risk; that could not be
  confirmed in this codebase state — `dev-preferences.md` is confirmed at three of four call sites.
  The implementing phase must enumerate the list rather than inherit the claim.

## Consequences

- **Phase 6's acceptance criterion 1 is not met as written, deliberately.** #2875 needs a scope
  update to match this decision before implementation. That is the cost of having measured the
  premise instead of executing it.
- Three loops that look duplicated remain, now with a recorded reason. Future reviews should treat
  *this file*, not the loops, as the answer.
- The `agents` bypass closes; the `runtime-artifact-layout.cts:277-297` comment is rewritten rather
  than deleted, because its "deliberate until X" framing is stale in a way a plain deletion would
  not capture.
- **F19's durability fix lands here rather than in #1874**, per maintainer direction on #2875.
  #1874's F5, F6 and F18 are untouched.
- The regression test for F19 must inject the crash window by monkeypatching the `fs` method and
  restoring in a `finally` — **never** via `chmod`/permission tricks, which root bypasses, yielding a
  test that passes with zero coverage in root Docker and CI.

## Alternatives considered

1. **One materializer, three callers delegate — Phase 6 as originally scoped.** Rejected on the
   measured evidence above: it forces either `applySurface` off its non-wiping prune or
   `installRuntimeArtifacts` into unnecessary temp-staging.
2. **One materializer with a preservation-strategy parameter.** Rejected. It preserves both
   behaviors but makes the module own two concepts and defer the choice to its callers — the exact
   widening [ADR-2866](2866-install-surface-resolution.md) warns future reviews to resist, and a
   strategy flag is how a shared module becomes two modules wearing one name.
3. **Do nothing; leave F19 to #1874.** Rejected. This phase rewrites that precise choreography, so
   landing the durability fix elsewhere means two conflicting passes over the same code.
4. **Delete the duplication comment as no longer true.** Rejected. It is not simply false — it is
   stale in a specific, informative way, and its "deliberate until X" condition is now partly met.
   A rewrite carries that; a deletion loses it.

## A note on the evidence

Blast-radius figures for this seam are **not** reliable and were not used to justify anything above.
`get_impact` on `installRuntimeArtifacts` resolved to a same-named test helper
(`tests/adapter-declarative-equivalence.test.cjs:52`) and reported zero affected — the same
name-collision failure mode that produced a misleading clean radius during
[#3544](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/3544). `applySurface` returned **CRITICAL /
184+** from one tool and **LOW / 0** from another, disambiguating to two different in-file matches of
the same name. The decision above rests on read code, not on those numbers.

## Amendment (2026-08-17, #2875): four factual claims corrected by implementation

Implementing this ADR as Phase 6 disproved four of the statements it rests on. **The central
decision — §1, no single materializer — is unaffected and stands**; the divergence table that
justified it was measured correctly. What follows corrects the surrounding claims, because a reader
who acts on them will be misled.

This is the same failure mode the ADR itself warns about in "A note on the evidence": conclusions
reached by reading code without executing it. Three of the four corrections below are cases where
inspection produced a confident, wrong answer.

### 1. §Decision 3 is void — the retired-kind prune already had a single owner

The ADR says the prune "is extracted" and is "already called by both `installRuntimeArtifacts` and
`applySurface`". Measured: `pruneRetiredRuntimeArtifacts` already lives alone in
`src/retired-artifact-cleanup.cts`, already exports a single function, already routes every fs call
through `installFs()`, and has **three** callers — `installRuntimeArtifacts`,
`uninstallRuntimeArtifacts` and `applySurface`.

There was nothing to extract. **No refactor was invented to satisfy this decision.** A future reader
should treat §3 as already-satisfied, not as outstanding work.

### 2. The `agents`-bypass runtime set was wrong, and §Decision 4 was the *hardest* part, not the easiest

The ADR states the inline dispatch "survives only for codex, cline, hermes and generic runtimes",
and calls closing it "the part of Phase 6 whose evidence survived scrutiny intact".

Both are wrong. `_DESCRIPTOR_AGENTS_RUNTIMES` (`bin/install.js`) held ten runtimes; every other
runtime reached the inline loop — **seven** of them: claude (the flagship), cline, codex, hermes,
kilo, opencode and kimi-code. (`pi` is excluded separately by its `pluginOnlyInstall` branch.)

> **Even this correction undercounted.** It originally said six. `kimi-code` was found only when a
> golden install-tree fixture went red mid-implementation — not by any amount of reading. That is
> the third time this phase's enumeration was short (four call sites → seven; six runtimes →
> seven), and every miss shares one cause: counting by *symbol* or *set membership* when the thing
> that matters is a *behavior*. Fixtures and executed tests found what inspection did not.

The set and the loop are both **gone** as of this phase; the descriptor is authoritative for
`agents` on every runtime, so there is no longer an allow-list to join.

Worse, closing the bypass could not be done "on its own terms". It required **three new pieces of
descriptor contract**, because the descriptor pipeline had no per-agent resolution context:

| gap | consumer |
|---|---|
| a frontmatter-extensions step (`effort`, `disallowedTools`) | claude |
| per-agent model-override resolution threaded to the converter | kilo, opencode |
| a named branding converter (the *data* was already declared; the converter was not) | hermes |

Every one of those failed **silently** if migrated without the contract work — wrong bytes, nothing
thrown. §Decision 4's framing as independent and low-risk should not be relied on.

### 3. Three of the four blockers in `runtime-artifact-layout.cts` were already stale

The ADR treats that comment's blocker list as current. Measured, only one was:

| blocker | status |
|---|---|
| Copilot's `.agent.md` filename rename | stale — #2099 dropped the ternary; the suffix comes from `hostBehaviors.agentFileExtension` |
| cross-cutting path-prefix rewrite + attribution | stale — `stageAgentsForRuntimeWithConverter` already does both when `agentCtx` is present |
| stale-file cleanup | stale — `_removeGsdEntries` prunes more broadly than the loop's extension-gated check |
| config-reading steps | **real** — and it was the entire remaining gap (see §2 above) |

### 4. F19 is seven call sites, not four — and the helper was the wrong thing to search for

The ADR names four call sites, found by locating callers of `preserveUserArtifacts`. There are
**seven**. Three of them never call the helper at all; they open-code the same
`readFileSync` → wipe → `writeFileSync`.

**The generalizable lesson: the defect is the pattern "user data held only in memory across a
wipe", not the helper.** Searching for callers of the helper under-counts by construction. The three
extra sites were found by sweeping for the pattern — a read shortly before a wipe and a write
shortly after.

The ADR also understates the severity. The worst site is the mainline install path, where the
window spans the **entire `gsd-core` tree rebuild** inside `copyWithPathReplacement`, not a single
`rmSync`. Any interruption of a normal install destroys the file.

### 5. Resolved: `USER_OWNED_ARTIFACTS`

"What this ADR does not decide" records its membership as unconfirmable. It is confirmed:
`src/install-engine.cts` defines it as exactly **`['USER-PROFILE.md']`**, with a docblock recording
the invariant that a file is either manifest-tracked distribution or a preserved user artifact,
never both (#2771). `dev-preferences.md` is preserved at other sites by explicit name. That open
question is closed.

### 6. `copyPreservingSymlink` could not be reused verbatim

§Decision 2 directs reusing it, and that is still the right primitive for the reason given (it never
dereferences a symlink). But it used raw `fs` for all five of its calls, while its new caller sits on
the install path Phase 5 routed through an injectable seam. Verbatim reuse would have punched a hole
through that seam — the partial-adapter trap `install-fs-adapter.cts` documents. It was routed
through `installFs()` as part of the extraction; its existing migration caller is unaffected, since
the ambient default resolves to real fs.

**A caution for anyone extending this module:** that same fall-through is a live hazard. A missing
method on an injected adapter does not fail loudly — it silently reaches the real filesystem. Adding
a new `installFs()` call to a routed path without extending every adapter is a real-IO bug that
passes typecheck.

## Amendment (2026-08-18, #2866 complete): reconciled against the shipped environment

Epic #2866 is finished — phases 0-7 all closed. This ADR was written mid-epic and describes a tree
that no longer exists in three material ways. Reconciled below against the code as merged.

### 1. There are now TWO choreographies, not three

The Context section's table compares three: `installRuntimeArtifacts`, `applySurface`, and
`bin/install.js`'s agent-staging loop. **The third no longer exists.** Phase 6 (#2875) deleted that
loop and its `_DESCRIPTOR_AGENTS_RUNTIMES` gate outright; every runtime now materializes `agents`
from its capability descriptor. All that survives at the old site is a comment recording the
deletion.

So §Decision 1's refusal — "there will be no single materializer" — now governs a two-way
divergence, not a three-way one.

### 2. This ADR's own revisit condition has been MET, and revisiting does not change the answer

"What this ADR does not decide" said:

> **Whether the three choreographies ever unify.** The `applySurface` descriptor-agents migration is
> partly landed; when it completes, the shapes may converge enough that the question is worth
> reopening on evidence. Revisit then, not before.

That migration completed in Phase 6. Revisited, on evidence:

**The shapes did not converge on the axis that mattered.** The refusal rested on the prune, and the
prune is untouched by phases 6 and 7 — Phase 6 changed agent materialization, Phase 7 removed
exports. `applySurface` still prunes through `pruneSkillDirs`, described in its own source as "the
single point of truth", allow-list scoped so it *structurally cannot* delete a user's file; the
sibling branch still carries the note that "the unscoped prune deleted user-owned command files".
`installRuntimeArtifacts` still wipes a prefix-scoped set and restores a snapshot.

A single writer would still have to give up one of those guarantees. **§Decision 1 stands**, now for
a narrower and better-evidenced reason: not "three loops differ" but "two loops hold incompatible
guarantees about user data, and one of them cannot lose it by construction."

Phase 6 strengthened rather than weakened that reasoning. Implementing #1874-F19 found **seven** call
sites holding user files in memory across a wipe, not the four recorded — a design that cannot delete
user files is worth more than one that promises to put them back.

### 3. Delivery status of each decision

| § | Decision | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | No single materializer | **Stands** — see above; now a two-way, not three-way, refusal |
| 2 | Durable user-artifact staging (F19) | **Delivered** in #2875 — `src/user-artifact-staging.cts`, seven call sites, recovery wired into both install and uninstall |
| 3 | Extract the retired-kind prune | **Was already true** when measured; nothing was extracted, and no refactor was invented to satisfy it |
| 4 | Close the `agents` bypass | **Delivered** in #2875 — but it was the *hardest* part, not the independent one this ADR predicted |
| 5 | Placement/content ownership unchanged | **Holds** — ADR-3660 and ADR-1508 seams intact |

### 4. What #2875's AC1 still says

The issue text still reads *"One module writes a `Layout`; the three former call sites delegate to
it."* That criterion is **deliberately unmet**, and now doubly stale: there are no longer three call
sites. Anyone reconciling the tracker should treat this ADR as the governing decision and #2875's
AC1 as superseded, not outstanding.

### 5. Related environment change worth knowing

Phase 7 (#2876) took `bin/install.js` from 197 exports to 127, retiring 9 dead names and 61
pass-throughs. Any future work in this area should reach the extracted modules through their own
interfaces; the installer no longer re-exports them. See
[ADR-1508's 2026-08-17 amendment](1508-runtime-artifact-conversion-module.md) for why that
compatibility spine existed and why it turned out to have no production consumer.
