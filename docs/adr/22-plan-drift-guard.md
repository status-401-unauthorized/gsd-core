# Plan-vs-codebase drift guard: defaults and symbol-resolver seam

- **Status:** Accepted — ratified 2026-07-17 (originally Proposed 2026-05-29); see "Ratification" below
- **Date:** 2026-05-29
- **Issue:** open-gsd/gsd-core#22

## Ratification (2026-07-17): Proposed → Accepted

Ratified by explicit maintainer directive; the Status field sat at Proposed for roughly 14 months against a decision that in fact shipped and closed within a day of the ADR being written (issue closed 2026-05-30, one day after the 2026-05-29 ADR date).

**Evidence the decision shipped**
- `src/plan-drift-guard.cts` implements the ADR's authority ladder and severity table as a pure decision module: `AUTHORITY_RUNGS` (grep=0…scip=4), `getEffectiveAuthority()` (auto-upgrades `grep`→`intel` when `intel.enabled`), and `classifyDriftSeverity()` producing the exact table (VERIFIED→none, MISSING@rung<3→needs-acknowledgement, MISSING@rung>=3→HIGH/hardBlock, AMBIGUOUS→MEDIUM, UNCHECKABLE→INFO); compiled to `gsd-core/bin/lib/plan-drift-guard.cjs` (gitignored generated artifact, `.gitignore:101`).
- `gsd-core/bin/shared/config-defaults.manifest.json:94-97` sets `plan_review.source_grounding` default `true` and `plan_review.source_grounding_authority` default `'grep'` — the default-on verification pass from Part 1 point 1.
- `capabilities/intel/capability.json` keeps `intel.enabled` default `false` and wires its `plan:pre` step (`intel api-surface`) with `onError: "skip"` — `intel.enabled` stays opt-in and the injection never blocks, per Part 1 points 2-3.
- `gsd-core/workflows/plan-review-convergence.md`'s "Source-grounding pass" section (~lines 184-208) implements the four-valued resolver contract (VERIFIED/MISSING/AMBIGUOUS/UNCHECKABLE), excludes plan-declared "Artifacts this phase produces," delegates severity to the `drift-guard` CLI seam rather than inline reviewer reasoning, and appends a "Verification coverage" block to REVIEWS.md.
- `gsd-core/workflows/plan-phase.md` §7.9 ("Regenerate API-SURFACE.md (intel gate)") regenerates the surface only when the intel step hook is active and injects it into the planner prompt labeled "HINT ONLY... MAY BE INCOMPLETE... Never treat the surface as exhaustive" — matching Part 1 point 2 verbatim.
- `gsd-core/workflows/settings.md` and `gsd-core/workflows/new-project.md` surface `plan_review.source_grounding` as a "Drift Guard" toggle/setup question; `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` documents both config keys, explicitly marking authority rungs 2-4 (treesitter/lsp/scip) as reserved with no effect in the current release.

Governance: owning issue open-gsd/gsd-core#22 — CLOSED, stateReason COMPLETED, closed 2026-05-30T21:08:13Z, labeled `enhancement` + `approved-feature`.

## Context

The planner regularly cites symbols that do not exist in the codebase — invented decorators, wrong dataclass fields, renamed CLI flags, mismatched signatures. The phenomenon is measured, not anecdotal: the *Practical Code Generation* hallucination taxonomy (arXiv:2409.20550) reports Dependency Conflicts (11.26%) and API Knowledge Conflicts (20.41%), which together describe exactly this failure. Today the drift is caught only at execution time by the executor (ImportError/AttributeError), at roughly 10–15 min/fix, a dozen per multi-wave phase.

`/gsd:plan-review-convergence` does not catch it because planner and reviewer both read the same channel (other plan files); the drift originates in that channel. The fix must introduce an out-of-band source of truth: the project's own source code.

GSD ships `intel.cjs` (`api-map.json` et al.), but: enabling `intel.enabled` populates nothing (the `gsd-intel-updater` LLM agent is never auto-spawned; population is a manual `/gsd:map-codebase --query refresh`); extraction is regex, JS/CJS/ESM only; intel is stale after 24h with no auto-refresh (`intelUpdate()` is a stub); useful intel therefore costs recurring LLM-agent token spend.

The feature has two halves with different dependencies: a **verification pass** that reads live source (needs no intel, works in any language) and a **surface-injection** step that renders `api-map.json` into `API-SURFACE.md` for the planner (needs intel).

## Decision

### Part 1 — Defaults

1. Ship the **verification pass on by default**, behind a new, additive config key `plan_review.source_grounding` (boolean, default `true`, opt-out). Surface it as one question in `/gsd:new-project` (default Y) and as a toggle in `/gsd:settings`. It stays on permanently with an easy off switch.
2. The **`API-SURFACE.md` injection** stays gated on the existing `intel.enabled` (default unchanged). It ships in this release but only activates for projects that opted into intel and populated it. Its planner instruction is a **hint** ("prefer symbols in API-SURFACE.md; it may be incomplete"), never a hard rule.
3. **`intel.enabled` stays opt-in.** Flip its default to `true` only once all three hold: (a) deterministic population (tree-sitter/CJS parse, not an LLM agent); (b) auto-refresh on staleness; (c) multi-language coverage. None of these block the drift guard, because the default-on half does not depend on intel.
4. Only new, additive config keys are introduced. No pre-existing default is changed.

### Part 2 — Symbol-resolver seam

The reviewer pass depends on a resolver seam, not a hardcoded tool:

    resolve(ref) -> VERIFIED{location, exported, signature?} | MISSING | AMBIGUOUS{candidates} | UNCHECKABLE{reason}

Resolution is **three-valued, not boolean**. `UNCHECKABLE` (the adapter cannot analyze this language or symbol kind) never blocks and never falsely blesses; it is recorded as a coverage gap. Only `MISSING` from a *capable* adapter is actionable.

Adapters form an authority ladder, selected by `plan_review.source_grounding_authority` (enum; default `grep`, auto-upgrades to `intel` when `intel.enabled`), with no prompt changes when climbing:

| Rung | Backend | Asserts | This release? |
|------|---------|---------|---------------|
| 0 | ripgrep / Read | name present in source | yes (default) |
| 1 | api-map.json (existing intel) | name in parsed export list | yes (when intel on) |
| 2 | tree-sitter | real declaration + kind | deferred (new dep) |
| 3 | LSP workspace/symbol | + resolved definition, signature | deferred (new dep) |
| 4 | SCIP / GitNexus (#3802) | + exported?, signature, references | deferred (new dep) |

Locked sub-decisions:
- **Severity.** `MISSING` from rung 0–1 -> `needs-acknowledgement` (the plan proceeds if the author confirms the symbol is new/dynamic, logged), not a hard block — because rung 0–1 produce false positives on dynamic dispatch, re-exports, metaprogrammed decorators, and generated code. Hard block (HIGH) is reserved for rung >=3 adapters that can prove absence. `AMBIGUOUS` -> MEDIUM. `UNCHECKABLE` -> INFO.
- **New vs. existing.** Plans declare created symbols in an "Artifacts this phase produces" section. The resolver only checks symbols not in that list, so greenfield work is never flagged MISSING.
- **Extraction contract.** The reviewer enumerates a fixed set of symbol kinds (`@decorators`, `Class.method`, `module.function`, `--cli-flags`, file paths, dataclass/struct fields) and must quote the plan line for each, so coverage is auditable.
- **Signature-drift** can only be asserted at rung >=3; rungs 0–1 return `UNCHECKABLE` for signatures (name-drift only this release).
- **Cadence.** Resolve once per unique symbol per convergence cycle (cache within the cycle); run the pass every cycle so cycle-N fixes are re-verified in cycle N+1.
- **Coverage reporting.** `REVIEWS.md` carries a "Verification coverage" INFO block listing every UNCHECKABLE/skipped symbol and why, so "the guard ran" can never silently mean "nothing was checked."

## Consequences

### Positive
- Every project gets drift protection on day one, in any language, with zero setup and zero token cost (live Grep/Read against ground truth).
- The high-authority, always-fresh check is the default; the low-authority, stale-able cache (intel) stays an explicit, paid opt-in.
- One interface, many backends: raising verification authority (grep -> intel -> tree-sitter -> LSP -> SCIP) is a config change, never a workflow rewrite — the durable lever against worsening hallucination.
- Three-valued resolution refuses the RAG trap where missing context is treated as permission to invent, and cannot be poisoned by stale/partial intel.
- `needs-acknowledgement` keeps the default-on gate tolerable (no blocking valid plans), preserving adoption.
- Honors the issue author's own sequencing ("treat the default flip as a separate proposal") and changes no established default.

### Negative
- Two config surfaces (`plan_review.source_grounding` and `intel.enabled`) instead of one.
- This release's rung 0–1 catch name-drift but not signature-drift; signature coverage waits on a rung >=3 adapter.
- Requires planners to populate the "Artifacts this phase produces" section reliably; a missing list degrades precision (new symbols flagged for acknowledgement).
- The default-on pass adds reviewer tool calls per convergence cycle (bounded by the cadence rule above).

## Alternatives considered

- **Flip `intel.enabled` to default-on and gate the whole feature on it.** Rejected: enabling intel populates nothing, so default-on intel makes `API-SURFACE.md` inject a near-empty surface; combined with a "use only these symbols" instruction it tells the planner the codebase is empty — strictly worse than no surface. Also imposes silent emptiness on non-JS projects, widens the stale-data window, and pulls solo devs toward unrequested agent-token spend.
- **Ship the feature opt-in (default-off).** Rejected: the protection is free in the default (live-source) configuration; opt-in would leave most projects unprotected for no benefit while hallucination worsens.
- **Hardcode Grep/Read in the reviewer prompt.** Rejected: binds the workflow to one tool, over-claims ("found in text" = "verified"), and forces a prompt rewrite to adopt a better backend later.
- **Boolean resolution (verified / not-verified).** Rejected: collapses "couldn't check" into "missing," producing false positives on every unsupported language and silently blessing nothing.
- **Hard-block on any MISSING (as originally proposed).** Rejected for rung 0–1: false positives from dynamic/re-exported/generated symbols would block valid plans and get the default-on guard switched off. Retained only for rung >=3.
