title: TDD Pipeline Mode
group: v1.36.0 Features
---

**Purpose:** Opt-in TDD (red-green-refactor) as a first-class phase execution mode. When enabled, the planner aggressively selects `type: tdd` for eligible tasks and the executor enforces RED/GREEN/REFACTOR gate sequence with fail-fast on unexpected GREEN before RED.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-TDD-01: `workflow.tdd_mode` config key (boolean, default `false`)
- REQ-TDD-02: When enabled, planner applies TDD heuristics from `references/tdd.md` to all eligible tasks (business logic, APIs, validations, algorithms, state machines)
- REQ-TDD-03: Executor enforces gate sequence for `type: tdd` plans — RED commit (`test(...)`) must precede GREEN commit (`feat(...)`)
- REQ-TDD-04: Executor fails fast if tests pass unexpectedly during RED phase (feature already exists or test is wrong)
- REQ-TDD-05: End-of-phase collaborative review checkpoint verifies gate compliance across all TDD plans (advisory, non-blocking)
- REQ-TDD-06: Gate violations surfaced in SUMMARY.md under `## TDD Gate Compliance` section

**Configuration:** `workflow.tdd_mode`
**Reference files:** `tdd.md`, `checkpoints.md`

#### RED evidence formats

`check tdd-red-evidence` selects a parser by the captured report format. Node's
built-in runner and Vitest (`tap` and `tap-flat`) share the TAP adapter; Maven
Surefire and Failsafe share the JUnit XML adapter; `swift test` (swift-testing)
and Python `unittest` text output have their own adapters. The command name does not
select or bypass validation. Reports from other producers can use these same
formats. Unsupported or malformed reports return `INVALID_RED` with
`evidence.report_errors`; configure a supported reporter before proceeding.

`src/report-parser.cts` owns the adapters and their common result contract:
individual test identities, optional class groups, pass/fail/skip/TODO statuses,
and report validity. A new format needs an adapter and regression evidence;
the RED policy in `src/tdd-red-evidence.cts` stays independent of the format.
No runner-specific TAP summary counters are required.

The gate rejects incomplete plans/documents, bailouts, skipped/TODO/cancelled targets,
and ambiguous names. Qualify repeated TAP names with their suite path, and
repeated JUnit class names with their package, and repeated `unittest` methods
with their `module.Class.method` id. A swift-testing target is its display name
or its function name; repeated swift-testing names cannot be qualified and
block GREEN. Evidence counts are individual
tests, excluding suite-closing TAP points; a `unittest` method with failing
subTests or a parameterized swift-testing test counts once. `evidence.matched_test` and the
persisted `failing_test` identify the target failure rather than an unrelated
first failure. Report freshness and whether the assertion tests the intended
behavior still require executor inspection; the parser cannot establish them.

The upstream parsers (`tap-parser` and `saxes`) ship as reproducible bundles,
including license notices, so installed runtimes need no `node_modules`.
