# Host Integration Capability Matrix

This document is the maintainer-facing source of truth for the `hostIntegration` block in every
`capabilities/<cli>/capability.json` runtime descriptor. Every per-CLI axis value is either:

- **documented** — backed by a cited authoritative source and evidence quote, or
- **`undocumented`** — the explicit fail-closed sentinel used when the CLI's public documentation
  does not state a value for that axis. `undocumented` validates in the registry but never
  propagates into effective axes: negotiation degrades closed to the safe default.

Values are generated from per-CLI documentation research (Context7 + official docs). They are
consumed verbatim by `gen:capability-registry` and validated by `capability-validator.cjs`.

---

## Axes legend

| Axis | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `embeddingMode` | Whether the CLI exposes an in-process programmatic API (`imperative`) or integrates purely through configuration files (`declarative`). |
| `commandSurface` | How slash commands are registered: `slash-file` (markdown), `slash-toml` (TOML), `slash-programmatic` (code API), `palette`, `prose-only`. |
| `modelMode` | Whether extensions can programmatically request or supply a model (`active`) or select only by config (`passive`). |
| `hookBus` | Who owns the hook lifecycle: `host` (the CLI fires hooks), `engine` (VS Code/Electron extension host), `none`. |
| `stateIO` | Filesystem access model: `filesystem` (full local FS), `sandboxed-storage`, `session-log-append`. |
| `transport` | Integration transport: `mcp` (Model Context Protocol), `native-extension`. |
| `runtime` | Plugin/extension execution runtime: `node`, `bun`, `python`, `go`, `rust`, `electron`, `sandboxed-web`, `other`. |
| `effortSurface` | How reasoning effort reaches this host: `argv` (deliverable as an argument on the host's own invocation), `none` (the host exposes no reasoning-effort mechanism), or `undocumented`. Added by #2481; there is deliberately **no** config-file member — the only host that ever had one (Gemini CLI's `thinkingConfig`) was removed as a sunset runtime, and naming a member with no host would be a guess. |

### dispatch sub-axes

| Sub-axis | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `namedDispatch` | Whether agents can be invoked by name (true/false/`undocumented`). |
| `nested` | Whether subagents can themselves spawn subagents (true/false/`undocumented`). |
| `maxDepth` | Maximum nesting depth (integer; -1 = unbounded; `undocumented`). |
| `background` | Whether subagents can run asynchronously in the background (true/false/`undocumented`). |
| `subagentToolkit` | Tool surface available to subagents: `full`, `read-only`, `built-in-only`, or `undocumented`. `built-in-only` means the host ships a fixed set of built-in subagent types whose tool surfaces differ from one another, so no single `full`/`read-only` value describes them; it degrades closed to `read-only` in the negotiated axes. |
| `backgroundDispatch` | Whether a BACKGROUND-dispatched sub-agent can itself spawn further named sub-agents — the #853 discriminator (true/false/`undocumented`). |

### Interface points

| Point | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `command` | Slash-command routing and invocation capability. |
| `dispatch` | Subagent/multi-agent dispatch capability. |
| `model` | Programmatic model selection capability. |
| `hooks` | Lifecycle hook registration capability. |
| `state` | Filesystem/state I/O capability. |
| `artifact` | Artifact delivery (skills, commands) surface capability. |

## codex

> **Note:** ADR-1239's host matrix lists Codex as `prose-only`; current OpenAI Codex dev docs document slash-commands, so `commandSurface` is `slash-file` here (docs are the source of truth).

**GSD integration status — Phase D dogfood complete (#2088, ADR-1239).** Codex installs through the `declarative` embedding adapter (`createDeclarativeAdapter` → `installRuntimeArtifacts`); the hardcoded `runtime === 'codex'`/`isCodex` projection is folded into descriptor-driven `runtime.hostBehaviors`, and install/uninstall output is byte-parity-gated (`tests/fixtures/golden-install-parity/codex.json`). Three capability upgrades land, each with a test driving the user-reachable surface:

- **Skill root** — skills install to the canonical `$HOME/.agents/skills` (Codex core-skills `loader.rs` user-scope root), not the deprecated `$CODEX_HOME/skills` fallback. Declared via the skills-kind `home: ".agents"` override; pre-move installs are migrated (stale `~/.codex/skills/gsd-*` cleaned on both install and uninstall).
- **Hook events** — GSD registers all documented `hooks.json` lifecycle events beyond `SessionStart`: `SubagentStart`, `Stop`, `PostToolUse` (#772), plus the six added in #2088 — `PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `SubagentStop`, `UserPromptSubmit` — all routed through `gsd-context-monitor.js`. (The descriptor `extendedHookEvents` field reflects the schema-valid cross-runtime subset `SubagentStop`/`Stop`/`PreCompact`; Codex's full event set is codex-hooks-json-native, registered directly in `hooks.json`.)
- **Dispatch tuning** — `[agents] max_depth = 1` is written explicitly into the managed `config.toml` block, pinning the `dispatch.maxDepth: 1` axis instead of relying on codex-cli's implicit default. Because `maxDepth === 1`, `degradationFor` flattens GSD-hosted wave dispatch to single-level even though `dispatch.nested`/`background`/`backgroundDispatch` are all `true`. The block is a bare `[agents]` AgentsToml scalar table; it does **not** carry per-role `[agents.gsd-*]` sub-tables — those pointed `config_file` back at the standalone `agents/gsd-*.toml` files Codex already auto-discovers, so emitting them was a duplicate role registration (Codex logged "Ignoring malformed agent role definition: duplicate agent role name" once per agent) removed in #2406. `validateCodexConfigSchema` permits a known-scalar-only `[agents]` while still rejecting `[[agents]]` and unknown-key forms.

Documentation gaps:
- dispatch.maxDepth is configurable (Option<i32> with no documented upper bound); the documented default is 1 but the actual enforced maximum is not stated.
- dispatch.subagentToolkit: docs say subagents 'inherit the tool surface' but do not enumerate whether any tools are excluded.
- runtime: the Node.js entry point is a thin launcher shim; the actual agent execution runtime is a compiled Rust binary — axis classification is ambiguous.

Two capability upgrades land, each with a test driving the user-reachable surface:

- **Expanded hook-bus coverage** — GSD registers all 6 managed lifecycle events in `hooks.json` beyond the original `sessionStart`/`postToolUse`: `preToolUse`, `stop`, `subagentStart`, `subagentStop` (AC4a, cite https://cursor.com/docs/hooks). The hook-bus binding is descriptor-driven via `src/host-integration-adapters/imperative-hook-bus.cts` (reads `hostBehaviors.managedHookEvents`), not a hardcoded event pair.
- **Named/background nested subagent dispatch** — `dispatch.background`/`backgroundDispatch`/`nested` are all `true` with `maxDepth: 2`; `shouldFlattenDispatch(cursor)` returns `false` so GSD's wave-based execution drives Cursor's native background + depth-2 nested subagent dispatch instead of flattening to inline sequential calls (AC4b, cite https://cursor.com/docs/subagents + https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript).

**GSD integration status — Phase D dogfood complete (#2090, ADR-1239).** Cline installs through the `imperative` embedding adapter (`createImperativeAdapter` → `installRuntimeArtifacts`); the hardcoded `runtime === 'cline'` / `isCline` projection is folded into descriptor-driven `runtime.hostBehaviors`, and install/uninstall output is byte-parity-gated (`tests/fixtures/golden-install-parity/cline.json`). Two capability upgrades land, each with a test driving the user-reachable surface:

- **`AgentPlugin.hooks.beforeTool` planning guard** — the `.clinerules/hooks/PreToolUse` file-convention hook (#787) is re-implemented as a real Cline SDK `AgentPlugin` registered through the negotiated `hookBus: host` interface point. Guard semantics are preserved exactly (fail-open, cancels write-class calls targeting `.planning/`); the SDK maps the file hook's `{cancel, errorMessage}` to `{skip, reason}`. The binding lives in `src/host-integration-adapters/cline-sdk-binding.cts` (cite https://github.com/cline/cline/blob/main/docs/sdk/plugins.mdx).
- **`createAgentModel` per-subagent model overrides** — `DefaultGateway.createAgentModel({providerId, modelId})` is wired so GSD's `model_overrides` / `model_profile_overrides` resolution (already used for OpenCode/Codex passive hosts) applies to cline subagents (`modelMode: active`), instead of leaving model selection untouched (cite https://github.com/cline/cline/blob/main/docs/sdk/reference/gateway.mdx).
- **Dispatch stays degraded/flat (deliberate)** — unlike cursor's dispatch upgrade, cline's `dispatch` is `maxDepth: 1`, `nested: false`, `subagentToolkit: 'read-only'`, `backgroundDispatch: false`. `shouldFlattenDispatch(cline)` returns `true` and `degradationFor('dispatch', cline)` returns `{level:'degraded', fallback:'flat dispatch — waves run inline'}`. This is NOT upgraded: cline's own docs restrict subagents to a single level with a read-only toolkit and no nested spawning, so claiming full dispatch would misrepresent the host and violate the fail-closed negotiation contract (cite https://github.com/cline/cline/blob/main/docs/features/subagents.mdx).

**EoS migration status (#2091):** Migrated onto the imperative adapter. All `runtime === 'hermes'` branches in `bin/install.js` folded into descriptor-driven `runtime.hostBehaviors`. New `extensionEvents: "hermes"` dialect registered (13 real plugin hook events, replacing the borrowed `hookEvents: "claude"` 6-event surface).

Documentation gaps:
- runtime — Hermes plugins and agent core run in Python, but this was confirmed by code inspection rather than explicit docs statement.
- dispatch.namedDispatch — docs explicitly confirm no named-agent dispatch in delegate_task; Kanban has named profiles but that is a separate board system not a dispatch mechanism.

**EoS migration status (#2096):** Migrated onto the declarative adapter. All `runtime === 'antigravity'` / `isAntigravity` / `canonical === 'antigravity'` branches folded into descriptor-driven `runtime.hostBehaviors` + `runtime.hostIntegration`: `getConfigDirFromHome` (`bin/install.js`) now branches on `configHome.kind === 'dot-home-nested'` instead of a hardcoded runtime literal; `projectLocalHookPrefix` (`src/shell-command-projection.cts`) reads `hostBehaviors.hookPathStyle` (`'raw'` → bare `dirName`, no `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` anchor); `applyAgentPathRewrites` (`src/runtime-artifact-conversion.cts`) reads `hostBehaviors.noPathRewrite` to skip the `~/.claude/` → pathPrefix rewrites; and `getProjectInstructionFile` (`src/runtime-name-policy.cts`) reads `hostBehaviors.projectInstructionFile` (`"GEMINI.md"` — Antigravity CLI's `contextFileName`, successor to the sunset Gemini CLI per #1928) instead of a hardcoded `canonical === 'antigravity'` check. The dead `isAntigravity` branches these functions previously carried are removed. `dispatch.subagentToolkit` flipped `undocumented` → `full` per the citation above (antigravity.google/docs/cli/features); `dispatch.namedDispatch`/`nested`/`maxDepth`/`backgroundDispatch` stay `undocumented` — no authoritative source states named/nested/depth-bounded dispatch or a `run_in_background`-style call-time param, so `negotiateHostCapabilities` degrades all four closed to their most-restrictive value (false/0), and `shouldFlattenDispatch` still forces antigravity's dispatch to flatten (inline) despite `dispatch.background: true`, because `backgroundDispatch` itself never reaches `true`. Two upgrades land: **UPGRADE 1 — permission-writer** (`configureAntigravityPermissions`, `runtime.permissionWriter: "antigravity"`) writes Antigravity's native `{"permissions":{"allow":[...]}}` schema (antigravity.google/docs/cli/permissions) into the same `settings.json` GSD's own hook registration writes, granting GSD's own `read_file`/`command` rules non-destructively. **UPGRADE 2 — MCP companion config** (`configureAntigravityMcpConfig`) writes a standalone `mcp_config.json` (antigravity.google/docs/cli/gcli-migration) registering the `gsd` MCP server, non-destructively preserving any other `mcpServers` entries. Both upgrades are covered by `tests/antigravity-upgrades.test.cjs`; the axis/negotiation/source-grep coverage above is in `tests/declarative-reference-antigravity.test.cjs`.

**EoS migration status (#2097):** Folded onto descriptor-driven dispatch.
Augment already installed through the declarative adapter (nested-skill
artifact layout, `settings-json` hook surface, Claude hook event dialect), but
carried two remaining runtime-literal branches in
`src/runtime-artifact-conversion.cts`: the 4 `~/.augment`/`$HOME/.augment`
dot-dir rewrites in `_applyRuntimeRewrites`'s `case 'augment':` block are now
built from `getDirName('augment')` (dirName-derived, byte-identical) instead
of a hardcoded `.augment` literal, and the
`applyRuntimeContentRewritesForCommandsInPlace` command-body conversion
dispatch now reads `runtime.hostBehaviors.commandBodyConverter`
(`"convertClaudeToAugmentMarkdown"`) instead of a hardcoded
`runtime === 'augment'` branch. Two dead-code sites were also removed from
`bin/install.js`: the orphaned `claudeToAugmentTools` map (superseded by the
single-sourced converters per ADR-1508 / #1675) and the unreachable
`else if (isAugment) { content = convertClaudeAgentToAugmentAgent(content); }`
inline agent-conversion branch (augment has been on the descriptor-agents path
since `_DESCRIPTOR_AGENTS_RUNTIMES` was introduced, making that `if`/`else if`
arm dead). **UPGRADE 3 — MCP companion config**
(`mergeGsdMcpServerIntoSettings`) registers the `gsd` MCP server directly
inside the same `settings.json` `mcpServers` block GSD's own hook
registration already writes (Augment hosts MCP in `settings.json`, unlike
Antigravity's standalone `mcp_config.json`) — non-destructively preserving
any other user-configured `mcpServers` entries; uninstall removes only the
GSD-owned `gsd` entry. `settings.json` is golden-excluded
(`HOOK_CONFIG_FILES`), so this upgrade produces no golden fixture change.
Source-grep guard + fail-closed negotiation coverage is in
`tests/declarative-reference-augment.test.cjs`; the dispatch/hook-bus/MCP
upgrade coverage is in `tests/augment-upgrades.test.cjs`.

The two remaining `isCodebuddy` branches in `bin/install.js` — a duplicate `commands/` slash-command output report, and a dead legacy agent-converter dispatch arm (unreachable since codebuddy is in `_DESCRIPTOR_AGENTS_RUNTIMES`) — were folded onto the already-generic `runtime.hostBehaviors.reportCommandsDir` (shared with Cursor) and removed outright; `isCodebuddy` no longer appears as a live read anywhere in `bin/install.js`, `src/runtime-artifact-conversion.cts`, `src/shell-command-projection.cts`, or `src/runtime-name-policy.cts`. Two upgrades land: (1) **extended hook events** — codebuddy's `extendedHookEvents` was previously `[]` (none wired); this PR wires all four — `SubagentStop`/`Stop`/`PreCompact`/`SubagentStart` — into `extendedHookEvents` (mirrors qwen/kimi), so an install now registers all four as hooks in `settings.json` alongside the pre-existing base session/tool events (`SessionStart`/`PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`); cite https://www.codebuddy.ai/docs/cli/hooks. (2) **`dispatch.background`** — the descriptor already declared `true`, exceeding the `declarative-cli` profile baseline of `false`; the negotiation contract (`negotiateHostCapabilities`) now surfaces that value with no downgrade warning, documenting the legitimate deviation. Note: the CodeBuddy CLI has no background-dispatch frontmatter field on sub-agents (`agentMode`/`enabledAutoRun` are IDE-only per https://www.codebuddy.ai/docs/cli/sub-agents) — background dispatch remains a caller-side invocation parameter (`run_in_background: true`), not a field GSD's agent artifacts emit.

**EoS migration status (#2099):** Migrated onto the declarative adapter (dogfooded in `tests/declarative-reference-copilot.test.cjs`). The residual `isCopilot` branches were folded onto descriptor-driven `runtime.hostBehaviors`: the `.agent.md` destination-suffix rename in `src/install-engine.cts` now reads `hostBehaviors.agentFileExtension`; `bin/install.js`'s two uninstall side-effect branches (repo-root `AGENTS.md` cleanup, `copilot-instructions.md`/hook cleanup) now gate on `resolveInstallPlan(runtime).installSurface === 'copilot-instructions'` (unique to copilot, so byte-identical); and the two `skipSharedHooksInstall` checks now read `hostBehaviors.skipSharedHooksInstall:true` (copilot's golden has only `hooks/gsd-session.json`, no shared `gsd-*.js` scripts). A dead legacy agent-converter dispatch arm in the inline agent-copy loop — unreachable since copilot is a member of `_DESCRIPTOR_AGENTS_RUNTIMES` — was removed outright; `isCopilot` no longer appears as a live read anywhere in `bin/install.js` or `src/install-engine.cts`. Two upgrades land: (1) **multi-event hook bus** — `buildCopilotHookConfig()` previously emitted only `sessionStart`; this PR wires four additional events — `preToolUse`/`postToolUse`/`userPromptSubmitted`/`sessionEnd` — each a static, deterministic advisory command (no node-runner invocation), so an install's `hooks/gsd-session.json` now registers all five events. (2) **`dispatch.background`** — the descriptor already declared `true`, exceeding the `declarative-cli` profile baseline of `false`; the negotiation contract (`negotiateHostCapabilities`) surfaces that value with no downgrade warning, documenting the legitimate deviation. Note: Copilot's `.agent.md` frontmatter has no background-dispatch field (fields are `description`/`infer`/`mcp-servers`/`model`/`name`/`tools`) — background dispatch remains a negotiated-contract-only axis, not a field GSD's agent artifacts emit. MCP companion tooling is out of scope for this migration (AC4 names only the two upgrades above).

Documentation gaps:
- dispatch.subagentToolkit — docs describe per-subagent configurable permissions (allow/ask/deny) but do not document a single default toolkit level (full vs read-only) for subagents that lack explicit permission overrides.

**EoS migration status (#2093):** Migrated onto the imperative adapter. All `runtime === 'kilo'` / `isKilo` logic branches in `bin/install.js`, `src/install-engine.cts`, `src/runtime-artifact-conversion.cts`, and `src/runtime-artifact-layout.cts` folded into descriptor-driven `runtime.hostBehaviors` (`finishPermissionWriter`, `skipSharedHooksInstall`, and the skills converter registry are now resolved off the descriptor, not a hardcoded Kilo check). Four upgrades land: (1) **native hook-bus plugin** — `.kilo/plugins/gsd-core.js` (byte-identical to `.opencode/plugins/gsd-core.js`, cite: Kilo is an OpenCode fork sharing the same plugin/extension event bus) bridges GSD's hook scripts onto Kilo's plugin event bus; `extensionEvents: "kilo"` reuses `OPENCODE_EXTENSION_EVENTS` verbatim. (2) **active-model routing** — `convertClaudeToKiloFrontmatter` now emits a `model:` field from the resolved `model_overrides`/`model_profile_overrides.kilo.<tier>` value instead of always stripping it (mirrors the OpenCode upgrade; #2256). (3) **MCP companion documented** — `docs/how-to/connect-gsd-mcp-server.md` covers Kilo's `mcp`-keyed config (not `mcpServers`) and its `{type:"local", command, timeout}` entry shape. (4) **named subagent dispatch** — GSD's specialist agents install as `<configDir>/agents/gsd-*.md` with `mode: subagent` frontmatter (the slug Kilo's Task tool dispatches by) and a `permission:` block. `dispatch.subagentToolkit` stays `undocumented` — no authoritative Kilo doc states a default subagent toolkit level — so `degradationFor('dispatch', …)` returns `'degraded'`, not `'full'`, by design (fail-closed negotiation, not a regression).

- dispatch.nested — no documentation for nested sub-agent support in Windsurf Cascade.

- dispatch.subagentToolkit — no documentation for toolkit restrictions on Cascade sub-agents.
- runtime — Windsurf IDE is Electron-based but no programmatic plugin runtime is documented to developers.

**EoS migration status (#2100 Stage 2 — HOOK-BRIDGE):** `hooksSurface` moved from `"none"` to `"windsurf-hooks-json"`. GSD now wires two of Cascade's documented pre-hooks with BLOCKING semantics via `.windsurf/hooks.json` (local) / `~/.codeium/windsurf/hooks.json` (global): `pre_write_code` (write-path guard — blocks a write resolving to a different git root than cwd, or into a `.git/` internals directory) and `pre_run_command` (a conservative destructive-command deny-list — whole-disk/home `rm -rf`, force-push to a protected branch). Cascade blocks via **exit code 2** (+ a stderr reason string) — a materially different protocol from Cursor's stdout-JSON `{block, reason}` hooks.json form, even though the surrounding install/reconcile infra (`writeWindsurfHooksJson`/`removeWindsurfHooksJson` in `src/runtime-hooks-surface.cts`) mirrors `writeCursorHooksJson`/`removeCursorHooksJson`'s shape. Cascade has **no context-injection channel** (no `additional_context`-style advisory response channel), so the 4 advisory hook events GSD registers on Cursor (`sessionStart`, `postToolUse`, `stop`, `subagentStart`/`subagentStop`) have no Windsurf/Cascade counterpart and are deliberately **not ported** — only the 2 events with a genuine blocking analog are wired. `installSurface` stays `profile-marker-only` (unchanged); the hook bus is wired from inside that branch, gated on `hooksSurface === 'windsurf-hooks-json'` rather than a hardcoded runtime check.

**EoS migration status (#2094):** Migrated onto the imperative adapter — partially. Two `runtime === 'trae'` string-equality branches folded into descriptor-driven `runtime.hostBehaviors`: `skipSharedHooksInstall:true` gates the shared-hooks install (Trae has no hook surface: `hooksSurface: "none"`), and the `case 'trae'` global-config-dir path-rewrite's self-alias regex is now built off the descriptor's `dirName` rather than a hardcoded `~/.trae/` literal (byte-identical output). Skills dispatch was already descriptor-driven before this migration (`artifactLayout.skills.converter: "convertClaudeCommandToTraeSkill"`, resolved by converter name, not a runtime check). **Still runtime-keyed** (not folded by #2094, matching the same posture as cursor/windsurf/cline, pending a future cross-runtime content-dispatch consolidation): `RUNTIME_CONTENT_DISPATCH.trae` in `bin/install.js` — its `md`/`js` bodies are regex-callback rewrites that cannot be reduced to a byte-identical descriptor map; and the `case 'trae':` switch arm itself in `src/runtime-artifact-conversion.cts` — the arm's *structure* (not just its self-alias regex) is boilerplate shared verbatim across 7 runtimes (`codex`, `cline`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `augment`, `trae`, `codebuddy`) and remains a runtime-keyed `switch`. `trae` also remains in `RUNTIME_FLAG_IDS` (and `isTrae` remains in `bin/install.js`, gating only the agents-converter dispatch) pending the cross-runtime agents-converter dispatch migration — agents conversion is out of scope for #2094. One upgrade lands: **SOLO stage/trigger metadata** — every emitted `SKILL.md` now carries a `stage: workflow` frontmatter line (`runtime.hostBehaviors.soloStageMetadata`), so Trae's SOLO Agent can recognize GSD skills as workflow-stage skills for auto-invocation instead of requiring manual triggering; cite https://docs.trae.ai/ide/agent ("Agents in Trae can be called individually, or automatically called by SOLO Agent at the corresponding stage"). The field is a single fixed, best-effort/inferred GSD-side value — Trae's thin SPA docs don't publish a formal stage-metadata schema. The four `undocumented` dispatch sub-axes (`nested`, `maxDepth`, `subagentToolkit`, `backgroundDispatch`) keep dispatch flattened (`shouldFlattenDispatch` fails closed to inline) — fail-closed negotiation, not a regression.

---

## kimi

**EoS migration status (#2095):** Two upgrades landed. **Upgrade 1 — native hook bus:** `hooksSurface` moved from `"none"` to `"kimi-hooks-toml"` (`extendedHookEvents: ["SubagentStop", "Stop", "PreCompact", "SubagentStart"]`, `hookEvents: "claude"` — Kimi's 13 lifecycle events include exact-name equivalents for every Claude-dialect event GSD wires). GSD's hook scripts (session-state, phase-boundary, graphify, context monitor, the prompt/read/workflow/worktree guards, commit validation) are now registered as `[[hooks]]` entries in Kimi's own `config.toml` (default `~/.kimi/config.toml`, overridable via Kimi's own `KIMI_SHARE_DIR` env var — a directory deliberately separate from the `~/.config/agents` Agent-Skills root GSD installs into, since Kimi's docs confirm the skills search path is independent of `KIMI_SHARE_DIR`). GSD-owned entries are wrapped in `# GSD Hooks BEGIN`/`END` marker comments (`writeKimiHooksToml` / `stripKimiHooksTomlBlock` in `src/runtime-hooks-surface.cts`) so a reinstall replaces only GSD's own block, and `installSurface` deliberately stays `"profile-marker-only"` — the config.toml write is independent of the artifact-install surface. `hooks/` and `hooks/lib/` now install for kimi (the three `&& !isKimi` install-guard exclusions were removed) — but SELF-CONTAINED under kimi's own native hook root (`~/.kimi/`, alongside `config.toml`), never under the `~/.config/agents` Agent-Skills root: kimi declares `hostBehaviors.skipSharedHooksInstall:true` like Cline/Kilo/Cursor/Trae, so the shared install path never writes hooks/package.json there, and a dedicated call installs the same bundle into `resolveKimiHooksTomlDir()` instead, with `buildHookCommand` pointed at that root so the generated `[[hooks]]` command paths resolve. **Upgrade 2 — background dispatch:** `hostIntegration.dispatch.backgroundDispatch` flipped `false` → `true` (Kimi's `Agent` tool takes a call-time `run_in_background` param — same evidence as `dispatch.background` below), which flips `shouldFlattenDispatch` to `false` for kimi (may background, joining codex/cursor/opencode) — a negotiation-only axis with no install-output effect, confirmed via golden parity. Exercising the actual `run_in_background` call end-to-end is Kimi's own runtime behavior and is out of the installer's test scope; the installer's deliverable stops at the `kimi_cli.tools.agent:Agent` tool grant on the root agent YAML (`buildKimiAgentArtifacts`, only emitted when a subagent is present) plus the negotiated `backgroundDispatch` axis above — both covered by `tests/kimi-upgrades.test.cjs`. **MCP transport deferred:** kimi's `transport: mcp` axis (declared below) is descriptor-only, like every other runtime's — no runtime has installer-driven MCP registration (GSD's installer never invokes `kimi mcp add`); users register the GSD MCP companion server with Kimi CLI manually.

- runtime — CLI core is Python; a Rust Wire implementation also exists; docs do not state a canonical plugin extension runtime.

## kimi-code

> **`kimi-code` is a different product from `kimi` above — every axis below is sourced independently.** `kimi` is Moonshot's Python `kimi-cli` (`from kimi_cli.app import KimiCLI`, `~/.kimi/config.toml`, `--work-dir`); `kimi-code` is the TypeScript/Node **Kimi Code CLI** (`~/.kimi-code/config.toml`, `$KIMI_CODE_HOME`, process-cwd, `AgentSwarm`). None of the values here are inherited from the `kimi` section. See `docs/migration/kimi-to-kimi-code.md` for the user-facing split.

| Axis | Value | Source | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| embeddingMode | declarative | https://github.com/moonshotai/kimi-code/blob/main/docs/en/customization/plugins.md | "Plugins package reusable Kimi Code CLI capabilities into installable units — they can add Agent Skills, automatically load a specified Skill at session start, and declare MCP servers to provide real tool capabilities." A plugin is a `kimi.plugin.json` manifest plus markdown Skills; real tool capability arrives via external MCP processes. No in-process programmatic extension API is documented — the same shape as `codex` above. |
| commandSurface | slash-file | https://github.com/moonshotai/kimi-code/blob/main/docs/en/reference/slash-commands.md | "External skills are automatically registered as slash commands using the skill: namespace prefix. Users can invoke these by typing /skill:\<name\> followed by optional text, which is then appended to the skill prompt." Skills are `SKILL.md` markdown files with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `type`, `whenToUse`, `arguments`). |
| modelMode | passive | https://github.com/moonshotai/kimi-code/blob/main/apps/kimi-code/src/cli/commands.ts ; /docs/en/guides/getting-started.md | "`-m, --model <model>` — LLM model alias to use for this invocation. Defaults to `default_model` in config.toml." Model selection is config alias + `--model` flag + the interactive `/model` command; no API lets an extension programmatically supply a model. |
| hookBus | host | https://github.com/moonshotai/kimi-code/blob/main/docs/en/customization/hooks.md | "All hook rules are written in the `[[hooks]]` array in `~/.kimi-code/config.toml`, where each entry is one rule." The CLI fires the lifecycle events (`UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `PermissionRequest`, `PermissionResult`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `Stop`, `Notification`, `Interrupt`); each rule is `event` + optional `matcher` + `command` + optional `timeout` (1–600s, default 30). |
| stateIO | filesystem | https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code | "Kimi Code CLI is an AI coding agent that runs in your terminal — it can read and edit code, run shell commands, search files, fetch web pages, and choose the next step based on the feedback it receives." Full local filesystem; no sandboxed-storage tier is documented. |
| transport | mcp | https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code ; /docs/en/customization/plugins.md | "AI-native MCP configuration. Add, edit, and authenticate Model Context Protocol servers conversationally with `/mcp-config`, without hand-editing JSON." Plugin manifests additionally carry an `mcpServers` field. |
| runtime | node | https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code | "Requirements: Node.js ≥ 24.15.0, pnpm 10.33.0." The CLI is a TypeScript pnpm monorepo (`apps/kimi-code`, `packages/agent-core-v2`); hook commands are shell, and MCP servers are external processes. |
| effortSurface | *(not declared)* | https://github.com/moonshotai/kimi-code/blob/main/apps/kimi-code/src/tui/commands/registry.ts | Kimi Code documents `/effort` (alias `/thinking`) to change reasoning effort, but only as an **interactive slash command** — there is no `--effort`-style flag on its invocation, and `-m, --model` is the only model/effort-adjacent argv. The axis vocabulary is `argv` | `none`, and neither is accurate: `none` would deny a mechanism the host does have, and `argv` would claim one it does not expose. The descriptor therefore declares no value, which negotiation degrades closed identically to the sentinel. See Documentation gaps. |
| dispatch.namedDispatch | false | https://github.com/moonshotai/kimi-code/blob/main/docs/en/customization/agents.md ; `capabilities/kimi-code/capability.json` (`artifactLayout` — skills only) | "The system includes three built-in sub-agents: 'coder' for general software engineering tasks like file modification, 'explore' for read-only codebase navigation and summarization, and 'plan' for architecture design without file or shell access." GSD's kimi-code artifact layout installs Agent **Skills** only (no `agents` kind), so no named GSD subagent is ever registered with the host and every GSD role resolves to one of the three built-ins (`resolveDispatchType`, `src/host-integration.cts`). **This is a GSD-integration-scoped `false`, not a claim that the host lacks named agents — see Documentation gaps.** |
| dispatch.nested | true | https://github.com/moonshotai/kimi-code/blob/main/docs/en/customization/agents.md | The `coder` sub-agent "can dispatch its own nested sub-agents when a task decomposes naturally." (Agent files also expose a `subagents` delegation allowlist, where `subagents: []` is what *prevents* further delegation — nesting is the default.) |
| dispatch.maxDepth | undocumented | searched: https://github.com/moonshotai/kimi-code/blob/main/docs/en/customization/agents.md | Nesting is documented, but no maximum nesting depth is stated anywhere in the agents or tools reference. |
| dispatch.background | true | https://github.com/moonshotai/kimi-code/blob/main/docs/en/reference/tools.md | "**`Agent`** delegates a subtask to a sub-Agent. Supports foreground execution (waiting for completion) or background execution (returning a task ID). … `run_in_background` (boolean) - Optional - Defaults to false." |
| dispatch.subagentToolkit | built-in-only | https://github.com/moonshotai/kimi-code/blob/main/docs/en/customization/agents.md | The three built-ins carry deliberately different tool surfaces — coder "Shares most of the main Agent's toolset; can run shell commands, maintain todo lists, enter Plan mode, and invoke Agent Skills"; explore "Performs read-only operations only and does not modify any files"; plan "Even shell commands are not available". No single `full`/`read-only` value covers the set, so the `built-in-only` member applies (degrades closed to `read-only` when negotiated). |
| dispatch.backgroundDispatch | true | https://github.com/moonshotai/kimi-code/blob/main/docs/en/reference/tools.md ; /docs/en/customization/agents.md | The `coder` built-in "can dispatch its own nested sub-agents" and the `Agent` tool's `run_in_background` is a call-time parameter available to it, so a background-dispatched sub-agent may itself dispatch further. `AgentSwarm` additionally fans out concurrently: "By default the tool ramps up concurrency without an upper limit (5 subagents start immediately, then 1 more every 700 ms); set `KIMI_CODE_AGENT_SWARM_MAX_CONCURRENCY` to a positive integer to cap how many subagents run at the same time during that ramp, or leave it unset for no cap." |
| dispatch.isolation | orchestrator-worktree | https://github.com/moonshotai/kimi-code/blob/main/docs/en/reference/tools.md ; ADR-1239 §Codex-binding amendment | Neither `Agent` nor `AgentSwarm` exposes a working-directory/cwd parameter — sub-agents inherit the CLI's process cwd — and the CLI has no `--work-dir`-style flag (unlike `kimi`). GSD therefore creates, validates and merges the worktree itself and spawns the executor with that cwd (#2584). |

**Negotiation note.** Because `dispatch.namedDispatch` is `false`, `negotiateHostCapabilities` caps `nested`, `maxDepth`, `background` and `backgroundDispatch` to `false`/`0` in the **effective** axes for structural consistency (`src/host-integration.cts`). The declared values above are still the host-capability record the matrix exists to hold; they are what a future named-dispatch upgrade would negotiate against.

- /moonshotai/kimi-code (Context7)

Documentation gaps:
- **dispatch.namedDispatch — host capability vs. GSD surface.** Kimi Code *does* support user-authored named agents: "Beyond the three built-in sub-agents, you can define your own agents as Markdown files", discovered across five scopes (`--agent-file` > `.kimi-code/agents/`, `.agents/agents/` > extra dirs > `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/agents/` > built-in). The axis is `false` because GSD installs **no** agent files for this host, so its reachable dispatch surface is the three built-ins — flipping the axis without also shipping agent artifacts would reintroduce the dispatch failure recorded in `docs/migration/kimi-to-kimi-code.md` ("Every workflow that called a named GSD subagent … **failed at dispatch**"). Shipping GSD agent files to kimi-code is an unbuilt capability upgrade, not a gap in the host's documentation.
- **effortSurface — a real mechanism the vocabulary cannot name.** Kimi Code documents `/effort` (alias `/thinking`) for changing reasoning effort, but only as an interactive slash command; `-m, --model` is the only model-adjacent argv on its invocation. The axis vocabulary is `argv` | `none`, and neither is accurate here — `none` denies a mechanism the host has, `argv` claims one it does not expose. Kimi Code's descriptor was created a day after #2481 added the axis and has carried no value since. Resolving this needs a vocabulary decision (an interactive-only member, mirroring the deliberate absence of a config-file member), which is a negotiation change rather than a documentation one; until then the absent value degrades closed exactly as the sentinel does.
- **dispatch.maxDepth** — nesting is documented but no depth bound is published, so the axis carries the `undocumented` sentinel rather than a guessed integer.
- **runtime** — the published artifact is a single bundled binary; `Node.js ≥ 24.15.0` is stated as a *development* requirement. The sources are a TypeScript/Node monorepo, so `node` is the best-supported classification, but the docs do not name a canonical plugin-execution runtime (the same ambiguity noted for `codex` above).

## zcode

> ZCode (Z.ai) is a desktop Agentic Development Environment for the GLM-5.2 model, distributed as an Electron app. It exposes a Claude-Code-shaped extensibility surface (per-user `~/.zcode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, slash commands, named subagents, native MCP, and a plugin system). All values below are sourced verbatim from the official ZCode docs.

| Axis | Value | Source | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| embeddingMode | declarative | https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/plugin | "A single plugin can bundle several capabilities. ZCode detects which components a plugin includes from its directory layout" — plugins/skills/commands/agents are config/markdown files; no in-process programmatic extension API is documented. |
| commandSurface | slash-file | https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/commands | "Custom commands are stored as `.md` files under `~/.zcode/commands` ... invoke the command with `/command-name`" |
| modelMode | passive | https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/configuration | Models are connected by provider config (Z.ai/BigModel/OpenAI-compat/Anthropic-compat base URLs + API keys in Model Settings); no programmatic model request API is documented. |
| hookBus | host | https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/plugin | A plugin's bundled components include a "**Hook** — Automation hooks triggered on specific events" — the host fires the events a plugin subscribes to. |
| stateIO | filesystem | https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/skill | "User-level skills for ZCode Agent: `~/.zcode/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`" — full local filesystem (desktop app). |
| transport | mcp | https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/mcp-services | "MCP (Model Context Protocol) connects external capabilities ... type as `stdio` (SSE and HTTP remote servers are also supported)" — native MCP. |
| runtime | electron | https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/install (download path `cdn-zcode.z.ai/zcode/electron/releases/3.2.5/ZCode-3.2.5-mac-arm64.dmg`) | ZCode is shipped as an Electron desktop application; the release artifact lives under the `electron/releases` path. |
| effortSurface | undocumented | no authoritative doc — per-host reasoning-effort survey, #2481 (`09b535ac0`) | This host's documentation states no reasoning-effort setting, so the axis carries the fail-closed sentinel rather than inheriting a profile baseline. No host-specific URL is cited because the finding is an ABSENCE: #2481 surveyed all hosts for a reasoning-effort mechanism and found one only for claude/opencode/codex. |
| dispatch.namedDispatch | true | https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/subagents | "you can let the Agent pick the subagent automatically, or reference it with `@` in the chat box" — subagents are invoked by name via the Agent tool. |
| dispatch.nested | undocumented | searched: https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/subagents | The docs do not state whether a subagent can itself spawn further subagents. |
| dispatch.maxDepth | undocumented | searched: https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/subagents | No maximum nesting depth is documented. |
| dispatch.background | false | https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/subagents | "**Foreground execution.** Subagents run in the foreground ... Background execution is not enabled yet." |
| dispatch.subagentToolkit | full | https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/subagents | "**general-purpose** is the default built-in subagent ... It has access to all tools"; custom subagents default to "All permissions by default" (inherits every tool). |
| dispatch.backgroundDispatch | false | https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/subagents | "Background execution is not enabled yet" — background dispatch is therefore impossible. |
| dispatch.isolation | none | https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/subagents (shipped descriptor: `dispatch.backgroundDispatch: false`) | "Background execution is not enabled yet" — no concurrent fan-out primitive, so same-wave plans run inline/sequentially (#2584) |

- https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/plugin
- https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/configuration
- https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/install

Documentation gaps:
- dispatch.nested / dispatch.maxDepth — ZCode's subagent docs do not state whether subagents can spawn further subagents or any depth bound.
- configHome — skills/commands/agents homes are documented (`~/.zcode/skills`, `~/.zcode/commands`, `~/.zcode/agents`); the exact settings filename under `~/.zcode` (where MCP server config is stored) is not fully documented at time of writing.
- Maintenance note — ZCode is a young, fast-moving app (observed at v3.2.x); these axes may need revision as its on-disk config layout stabilizes. Because ZCode also natively imports skills/MCP from `~/.claude`, installing GSD to BOTH `claude` and `zcode` can surface duplicated skills inside ZCode; this overlap is expected and documented.

EoS migration status (#2101, ADR-1239): ZCode's install is fully dogfooded through the declarative adapter — its shared-hooks exclusion (previously a hardcoded `!isZcode` branch in `bin/install.js`) is now folded onto `hostBehaviors.skipSharedHooksInstall`, byte-parity with the prior install (ZCode's golden install tree has zero hook files). The two capability upgrades anticipated for ZCode both remain **blocked** on undocumented on-disk formats — `hookBus` and `transport` above stay documented-but-unimplemented pending ZCode publishing those formats, and implementing a guessed format risks a false-green descriptor, so neither upgrade is wired:
- **Hook automation** (the plugin `Hook` component, `hookBus: host` above) — https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/plugin documents the capability only at a high level ("Automation hooks triggered on specific events"; components are "detected from directory layout, shown as badges"). No config file format, on-disk location, event-name vocabulary, or payload schema is published, so GSD cannot faithfully wire hook events into a plugin bundle. BLOCKED (undocumented on-disk hook-config format).
- **MCP registration** (`transport: mcp` above) — https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/mcp-services confirms servers are "stored in the .zcode configuration file of the chosen scope" and accepts both a bare `{"server-name":{...}}` map and an `{"mcpServers":{...}}` wrapper shape, but does not document the exact settings filename/path or full schema (the docs describe the UI flow, not the on-disk contract) — this is the same gap already noted under `configHome` above. BLOCKED (undocumented settings-filename/schema gap).

## pi

> pi (pi.dev) is a bun-runtime Programmatic-CLI: it exposes an in-process TypeScript `ExtensionAPI` (`registerCommand`/`registerTool`/`registerProvider`/`pi.on`) rather than a settings-file or slash-markdown surface. GSD ships a single native-extension file (`pi/gsd.cjs`) installed to `~/.pi/agent/extensions/gsd.js` (global) or `.pi/extensions/gsd.js` (local) — the programmatic-CLI peer of the OpenCode/Kilo native-plugin binding. **Sourcing note:** the citations below are the pi.dev documentation pages named in ADR-1239 Stage 1 (#2102) as the source for each axis; this environment did not have live doc-fetch access at authoring time, so the Evidence column below is a paraphrase of pi's documented extension model rather than a verbatim excerpt — a maintainer with Context7/web access should verify the exact wording before treating this section as fully cited (flagged in the #2102 PR). **Partially discharged (#2470, 2026-07-20):** pi's extension-loader contract specifically has now been read at source — `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/loader.ts` in `earendil-works/pi` — confirming `discoverExtensionsInDir()` keeps only names passing `isExtensionFile()` (`.ts`/`.js`, everything else skipped silently), that accepted files load via `jiti` (CommonJS and ESM alike), and that explicit `settings.json` paths bypass the filter. The remaining axes below are still paraphrase.

| Axis | Value | Source | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| embeddingMode | imperative | https://pi.dev/docs/latest/extensions | pi extensions are loaded in-process (via jiti) and call an `ExtensionAPI` object directly (`registerCommand`/`registerTool`/`registerProvider`/`pi.on`) — an in-process programmatic API, not a config-file-only integration. |
| commandSurface | slash-programmatic | https://pi.dev/docs/latest/extensions | Commands are registered by calling `registerCommand(name, definition)` from extension code, not by dropping a markdown/TOML file — the command surface is code, not a file format. |
| modelMode | active | https://pi.dev/docs/latest/extensions | The `ExtensionAPI` exposes `registerProvider`, letting an extension supply/select model providers programmatically rather than only reading a static config value. |
| hookBus | host | https://pi.dev/docs/latest/extensions | `pi.on(event, handler)` subscribes an extension to host-fired lifecycle events (e.g. `tool_call`) — the pi host owns and fires the event bus; extensions only subscribe. |
| stateIO | session-log-append | https://pi.dev/docs/latest/session-format | pi persists conversation/tool-call state as an append-only session log/transcript format rather than exposing unrestricted local filesystem access to extensions. |
| transport | native-extension | https://pi.dev/docs/latest/extensions | Integration is a single loaded extension file (`~/.pi/agent/extensions/<file>.cjs`), not an MCP server process — the peer mechanism to OpenCode's native `plugins/*.js` adapter. |
| runtime | bun | https://pi.dev | pi is distributed and executed as a bun-runtime CLI (its extensions are loaded via jiti under bun, not Node.js or Python). |
| effortSurface | undocumented | no authoritative doc — per-host reasoning-effort survey, #2481 (`09b535ac0`) | This host's documentation states no reasoning-effort setting, so the axis carries the fail-closed sentinel rather than inheriting a profile baseline. No host-specific URL is cited because the finding is an ABSENCE: #2481 surveyed all hosts for a reasoning-effort mechanism and found one only for claude/opencode/codex. |
| dispatch.namedDispatch | undocumented | no authoritative doc — searched: https://pi.dev/docs/latest/extensions | The `ExtensionAPI` documents `registerCommand`/`registerTool`/`registerProvider`/`pi.on`; it does not document a named-subagent-invocation primitive. |
| dispatch.nested | undocumented | no authoritative doc — searched: https://pi.dev/docs/latest/extensions | No documented subagent-of-subagent nesting capability. |
| dispatch.maxDepth | 0 | no authoritative doc — searched: https://pi.dev/docs/latest/extensions | No named-dispatch primitive is documented at all (see `dispatch.namedDispatch`), so there is no nesting depth to bound; `0` records "no dispatch levels beyond the root extension," not a measured limit. |
| dispatch.background | false | no authoritative doc — searched: https://pi.dev/docs/latest/extensions | No documented background/async subagent-execution primitive. |
| dispatch.subagentToolkit | undocumented | no authoritative doc — searched: https://pi.dev/docs/latest/extensions | pi has no named-dispatch primitive (see `dispatch.namedDispatch`), so there is no subagent tool-surface to classify as `full`/`read-only`. |
| dispatch.backgroundDispatch | false | no authoritative doc — searched: https://pi.dev/docs/latest/extensions | Same gap as `dispatch.background` — no background-dispatch primitive is documented, so a background-dispatched agent spawning further named sub-agents is not possible. |
| dispatch.isolation | none | shipped descriptor (`dispatch.background: false`, `dispatch.backgroundDispatch: false`) | pi has no named-dispatch/background-dispatch primitive documented — cannot fan out concurrently, so isolation is moot (#2584) |

Sources consulted:
- https://pi.dev
- https://pi.dev/docs/latest/extensions
- https://pi.dev/docs/latest/session-format

Documentation gaps:
- dispatch.namedDispatch / dispatch.nested / dispatch.subagentToolkit — pi's `ExtensionAPI` (`registerCommand`/`registerTool`/`registerProvider`/`pi.on`) does not document a named-subagent-dispatch primitive at all, unlike Claude Code/Codex/OpenCode-style "Agent tool" surfaces; all three axes stay `undocumented` and negotiation fails closed (no named dispatch, dispatch flattened).
- dispatch.maxDepth / dispatch.background / dispatch.backgroundDispatch — recorded as `0`/`false`/`false` (not `undocumented`) because the absence of any dispatch primitive is itself the documented ceiling, matching `shouldFlattenDispatch`'s fail-closed default.
- This section's Evidence-column wording was authored without live Context7/web-fetch access (see the sourcing note above the table) — verify against the cited pi.dev pages before relying on it for a future capability upgrade.

EoS migration status (#2102 Stage 1, ADR-1239): pi lands as a NET-NEW installable runtime — pure additive descriptor + installer wiring, no prior `runtime === 'pi'` branches existed to fold. `artifactLayout` is declared empty (`global: []`, `local: []`) — pi has no skills/commands/agents layout, and installs as **PLUGIN-ONLY**: `hostBehaviors.pluginOnlyInstall: true` explicitly skips `bin/install.js`'s generic flat-commands-and-agents fallback (the legacy path Claude Code's LOCAL layout also uses), which would otherwise write inert `commands/gsd-<cmd>.md` + `agents/gsd-<name>.md` reference files no part of pi ever reads. pi's `/gsd` command and `gsd_invoke` tool are registered **programmatically** by the native extension (`pi/gsd.cjs` → `extensions/gsd.js`, mirroring OpenCode/Kilo's `nativePlugin` shape) — pi has no host-read markdown surface at all (unlike Claude/OpenCode/Kilo, which scan a `commands/`/`command/` directory), so a declarative artifact surface would be dead weight, not merely unused. `dispatch.subagentToolkit: "undocumented"` and `dispatch.backgroundDispatch: false` are both required by the capability validator's dispatch schema and reflect that pi has no documented named-dispatch primitive at all. (Stage 1 originally also set `hostBehaviors.skipSharedHooksInstall:true`, reasoning the staged `hooks/*.js` bundle would be dead weight for pi the way it genuinely is for Kilo/ZCode — **corrected in Stage 2 below**: pi's native extension DOES spawn them, so they are live, not dead, and the flag was removed.)

EoS migration status (#2102 Stage 2, ADR-1239): Stage 1's "in-process `gsd-core` command-routing hub" framing was aspirational and is corrected here — no fully-populated hub factory exists anywhere in gsd-core (every `createHub()` caller in the tree builds a single-family hub for its own narrow purpose), so `/gsd` and `gsd_invoke` instead dispatch via **SUBPROCESS REUSE**: `dispatchGsdCommand` (`src/shell-command-projection.cts`) spawns `gsd-core/bin/gsd-tools.cjs <family> [subcommand] ... --cwd <dir> --raw --json-errors` bounded and non-throwing, mirroring the precedent already established for the OpenCode/Kilo hook bridge (`.opencode/plugins/gsd-core.js`'s "Architecture: SUBPROCESS REUSE" header). The companion MCP server's `gsd_invoke_command` tool dispatches through the SAME shared helper (it had the identical `createHub()`-with-no-args bug). `/gsd`'s command handler is `handler(args, ctx)` (pi's real ExtensionAPI shape — a raw args string, not `execute(ctx)`); `gsd_invoke`'s tool handler is the real 5-arg `execute(toolCallId, params, signal, onUpdate, ctx)`. The event surface (`EXTENSION_EVENT_SURFACES.pi`, `src/host-integration.cts`) now declares the full ~30-event pi ExtensionAPI vocabulary (was a placeholder `['tool_call']`), and `pi/gsd.cjs` binds `session_start` (→ `gsd-ensure-canonical-path.js`), `before_agent_start` (→ `gsd-workflow-guard.js`, a forward-compatible no-op today since that hook's triggers are tool-scoped), `session_before_compact` (→ `gsd-context-monitor.js`), and `tool_call`, each as a bounded fail-open `spawnSync` subprocess (mirroring `.opencode/plugins/gsd-core.js`'s `runHook`). `modelMode: active` is realized via `pi.on('before_provider_request', ...)`, which resolves a tier through the model-catalog's now-populated `runtimeTierDefaults.pi` entries (bare anthropic ids — `claude-opus-4-8`/`claude-sonnet-5`/`claude-haiku-4-5`, matching the `claude` runtime's own ids since pi talks the anthropic API) and returns a modified payload, or `undefined` (fail-open, pi's model left untouched) when resolution comes back null — **not** `registerProvider`, which would register a new model provider rather than steering pi's existing built-in anthropic models.

**Adversarial-review correction (#2102 Stage 2, post-review):** the event bridges above and the `/gsd` tokenizer's `hooks/lib/git-cmd.js` require were DEAD in a real install — Stage 1's `hostBehaviors.skipSharedHooksInstall:true` meant pi shipped NO `hooks/` directory at all, so `runHook('gsd-ensure-canonical-path.js', ...)` etc. always hit the "hook file absent → silent no-op" branch, and the tokenizer always fell back to plain whitespace-splitting. The tests masked this because they run against the dev tree, where `hooks/` genuinely exists. **Fix:** `capabilities/pi/capability.json` no longer sets `skipSharedHooksInstall` — pi is architecturally identical to OpenCode here (`hooksSurface: "none"` + a native extension that spawns the staged hooks), not to Kilo/ZCode (`hooksSurface: "none"` with NO plugin surface, where the same hooks genuinely are dead weight). pi now installs `hooks/` + `hooks/lib/` (27 entries: the same `INSTALLED_HOOK_FILES` set OpenCode gets) alongside `extensions/gsd.js`, verified end-to-end via a real `node bin/install.js --pi --global`/`--local` — `resolveEngineRoot`'s walk-up from the installed extension's own directory finds `ENGINE_ROOT/hooks/{gsd-ensure-canonical-path.js,gsd-workflow-guard.js,gsd-context-monitor.js,lib/git-cmd.js}`, and each bridge/`runHook` call exits 0 against the real installed files. `hooksSurface: "none"` + `configFormat: "none"` + `writesSharedSettings: false` are unaffected — no settings/hooks.json/config.toml is written for pi; the extension spawns hooks by absolute path, not via a config-file hook bus. `tests/fixtures/golden-install-parity/pi.json` grew from 292 → 320 entries (the 28 new `hooks/`/`hooks/lib/` files); `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/` remain absent (`pluginOnlyInstall` is untouched — it only gates the declarative-markdown surfaces, not hooks). `tests/install-minimal-hooks.test.cjs`'s #1821 suite moved pi from the Kilo/ZCode (no-hooks) group into the OpenCode (ships-hooks) group accordingly.

| Axis | Value | Source | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| embeddingMode | imperative | https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api | The extension is loaded in-process by the extension host and calls the `vscode` namespace API directly (`vscode.commands.registerCommand`, `vscode.chat.createChatParticipant`, `vscode.lm.registerTool`) — an in-process programmatic API, not a config-file-only integration. |
| commandSurface | palette | https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/command | Commands are contributed via `contributes.commands` in package.json and registered with `vscode.commands.registerCommand`, surfaced through the Command Palette (and the Chat view via the chat participant) — not a markdown/TOML slash-command file format. |
| modelMode | active | https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/ai/language-model | The `vscode.lm` namespace lets an extension actively select a model (`vscode.lm.selectChatModels`) and send requests to it programmatically, rather than only reading a static config value. |
| hookBus | engine | https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/activation-events | VS Code has no cross-extension lifecycle-hook bus that GSD subscribes to; the extension host (the "engine" here, per this axis's own `host`/`engine`/`none` vocabulary) owns activation events, and GSD's own hook lifecycle runs fully in-process/engine-owned inside the extension. |
| stateIO | sandboxed-storage | https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#Memento | `context.globalState`/`context.workspaceState` (both `Memento`) are the extension's persistent storage surface — sandboxed key/value storage scoped to the extension, not unrestricted local filesystem access. |
| transport | mcp | https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/ai/mcp | VS Code 1.99 added native MCP client support; on the Web (webworker) entry, full GSD command dispatch is available through VS Code's native MCP client connecting to the GSD companion MCP server (`gsd-mcp-server`), not an in-process Node dispatch (which the web entry cannot run at all). |
| runtime | sandboxed-web | https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/web-extensions | The `browser` entry point (`vscode/browser.js`) runs in a webworker context with no Node core modules — the Web Extension execution model VS Code documents for extensions that must run in vscode.dev/github.dev. |
| effortSurface | undocumented | no authoritative doc — per-host reasoning-effort survey, #2481 (`09b535ac0`) | This host's documentation states no reasoning-effort setting, so the axis carries the fail-closed sentinel rather than inheriting a profile baseline. No host-specific URL is cited because the finding is an ABSENCE: #2481 surveyed all hosts for a reasoning-effort mechanism and found one only for claude/opencode/codex. |
| dispatch.namedDispatch | true | https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode#_agent-mode-tools | Registered `languageModelTools` (and the chat participant) are addressable by name — the primary agent references a tool/participant by its declared name/`toolReferenceName`, not only positionally. |
| dispatch.nested | true | https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat-agents (subagents) | VS Code's chat subagent model (`#runSubagent`) explicitly supports a subagent invoking further subagents, gated by `chat.subagents.allowInvocationsFromSubagents`. |
| dispatch.maxDepth | 5 | https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat-agents (subagents) | Documented as VS Code's maximum nesting depth for `#runSubagent` chains — also matches this repo's existing `PROFILE_BASELINES.ide.dispatch.maxDepth` baseline. |
| dispatch.background | true | https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/ai/tools | Language Model Tools can be invoked as part of an asynchronous agent turn (the primary agent does not block synchronously on a single extension call). |
| dispatch.subagentToolkit | undocumented | no authoritative doc found at authoring time | VS Code's subagent documentation does not state whether a subagent's tool surface is restricted to read-only tools or the full set an extension registers; recorded `undocumented` (fails closed to `read-only` in negotiation) rather than guessed. |
| dispatch.backgroundDispatch | undocumented | no authoritative doc found at authoring time | Whether a background-dispatched subagent can itself spawn further NAMED subagents (the #853 discriminator) is not stated in the sources reviewed; recorded `undocumented` (fails closed to `false`) rather than guessed. |
| dispatch.isolation | undocumented | not researched / no concurrent fan-out documented for this axis | no authoritative source consulted for concurrent-executor isolation on this host — fails closed to `none` (sequential) in negotiation (#2584) |

Documentation gaps:
- dispatch.subagentToolkit / dispatch.backgroundDispatch — the reviewed sources document that
  `#runSubagent` exists (v1.105+, `chat.subagents.allowInvocationsFromSubagents`, max nesting
  depth 5) but do not state the subagent tool-restriction model or whether a background-dispatched
  subagent can itself spawn further named subagents; both stay `undocumented` and negotiation
  fails closed.
- This section's Evidence-column wording was authored without live Context7/web-fetch access (see
  the sourcing note above the table) — verify against the cited pages before relying on it for a
  future capability upgrade, same caveat as the pi section above.

EoS migration status (#2103): vscode lands as a registry runtime (role:runtime) for
validator/host-integration coverage ONLY — it is deliberately NOT a CLI-installable runtime
(`installSurface: "none"`, never in `bin/install.js`'s `allRuntimes`; see the
`NON_INSTALLABLE_RUNTIMES` carve-out in `tests/runtime-flags.test.cjs`). The extension surface
(`vscode/extension.js`, `vscode/browser.js`, `vscode/host-binding.js`, `vscode/package.json`) is
distributed via the Marketplace/VSIX, not `npx --vscode` — there is no `docs/how-to/install-on-
your-runtime.md` entry for it. Dispatch is SUBPROCESS REUSE on desktop (the same shared
`dispatchGsdCommand` in `gsd-core/bin/lib/shell-command-projection.cjs` the pi extension and the
companion MCP server use) via `vscode/extension.js`'s `main` entry (Node). The `browser` entry
(`vscode/browser.js`) is a SEPARATE, independently zero-Node-API file: it does NOT require
`host-binding.js` because that module's engine-lib dependencies (`state-io.cjs`,
`adapter-imperative.cjs` → `install-engine.cjs`/`capability-loader.cjs`,
`model-adapter.cjs` → `model-resolver.cjs` → `config-loader.cjs`/`configuration.cjs`) all pull in
Node's `fs`/`os`/`path` at module-load time — requiring any of them from a webworker context would
throw immediately. `browser.js` instead composes its own minimal surface directly against
`vscode.lm`, and its command/tool/chat handlers surface an honest "full dispatch is unavailable on
web; configure the GSD MCP server" message rather than a silent failure. The chat participant
(`@gsd`) and Language Model Tools (a representative 3-tool set — `gsd_progress`, `gsd_workstreams`,
`gsd_plan_phase` — matching real shipped skills that map onto a single, safe, read-only
`gsd-tools.cjs` command) are registered on BOTH entries identically; only the dispatch behavior
differs. `#runSubagent` wiring (`registerSubagentDispatch`/`dispatchAsSubagent`, gated on
`chat.subagents.allowInvocationsFromSubagents` availability, fail-soft on older/Insiders-gated
hosts) adds a belt-and-suspenders `maxDepth: 5` ceiling independent of whatever VS Code's own chat
engine enforces natively — there is no separate extension-side "subagent contribution"
registration API beyond the chat participant + Language Model Tools already registered; VS Code's
chat engine surfaces them to `#runSubagent` on its own.
