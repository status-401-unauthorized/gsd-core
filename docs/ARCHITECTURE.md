## System Overview

GSD Core is a **meta-prompting framework** that sits between the user and AI coding agents (Claude Code, Kimi CLI, OpenCode, Kilo, Codex, Copilot, Antigravity, Trae, Cline, Augment Code). It provides:

1. **Context engineering** — Structured artifacts that give the AI everything it needs per task (see [Context engineering](explanation/context-engineering.md))
2. **Multi-agent orchestration** — Thin orchestrators that spawn specialized agents with fresh context windows (see [Multi-agent orchestration](explanation/multi-agent-orchestration.md))
3. **Spec-driven development** — Requirements → research → plans → execution → verification pipeline
4. **State management** — Persistent project memory across sessions and context resets

## Design Principles

### 1. Fresh Context Per Agent

Every agent spawned by an orchestrator gets a clean context window (up to 200K tokens). This eliminates context rot — the quality degradation that happens as an AI fills its context window with accumulated conversation.

### 2. Thin Orchestrators

Workflow files (`gsd-core/workflows/*.md`) never do heavy lifting. They:

- Load context via `gsd-tools.cjs init <workflow>`
- Spawn specialized agents with focused prompts
- Collect results and route to the next step
- Update state between steps

### 3. File-Based State

All state lives in `.planning/` as human-readable Markdown and JSON. No database, no server, no external dependencies. This means:

- State survives context resets (`/clear`)
- State is inspectable by both humans and agents
- State can be committed to git for team visibility

### 4. Absent = Enabled

Workflow feature flags follow the **absent = enabled** pattern. If a key is missing from `config.json`, it defaults to `true`. Users explicitly disable features; they don't need to enable defaults.

### 5. Defense in Depth

Multiple layers prevent common failure modes:

- Plans are verified before execution (plan-checker agent)
- Execution produces atomic commits per task
- Post-execution verification checks against phase goals
- UAT provides human verification as final gate

---

## Component Architecture

### Commands (`commands/gsd/*.md`)

User-facing entry points. Each file contains YAML frontmatter (name, description, allowed-tools) and a prompt body that bootstraps the workflow. Commands are installed as:

- **Claude Code:** Custom slash commands (hyphen form, `/gsd-command-name`)
- **OpenCode / Kilo:** Slash commands (hyphen form, `/gsd-command-name`)
- **Codex:** Skills (`$gsd-command-name`)
- **Copilot:** Slash commands (hyphen form, `/gsd-command-name`)
- **Kimi CLI:** Agent Skills (`/skill:gsd-command-name`) plus an explicit custom agent launch with `kimi --agent-file`
- **Antigravity:** Skills

**Total commands:** see [`docs/INVENTORY.md`](INVENTORY.md#commands) for the authoritative count and full roster.

#### Two-stage hierarchical routing (v1.40, [#2792](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core/issues/2792))

To keep the eager skill-listing token cost low, v1.40 introduces six namespace **meta-skills** (`gsd-workflow`, `gsd-project`, `gsd-quality`, `gsd-context`, `gsd-manage`, `gsd-ideate` — sourced from `commands/gsd/ns-*.md`, but the invocable `name:` is the bare form shown here) layered above the concrete sub-skills. On runtimes with non-recursive skill loaders (cline, qwen, hermes, augment, trae) the installer now realizes this fully: it emits only the 6 namespace router bundles as top-level skills and nests the ~61 concrete skills under `<router>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, so the eager listing is ≈6 entries instead of ≈67. The model selects a namespace router, which instructs it to read the nested concrete skill file via a routing table embedded in the router body. On these runtimes concrete skills are **not** directly invocable by bare name via the Skill tool; they are reachable through the router. Slash commands (`/gsd-*`, via the separate commands surface) are unaffected where the runtime has one. On runtimes with recursive or unconfirmed skill loaders (claude global, cursor, codex, copilot, windsurf, codebuddy, opencode, kilo, antigravity) the layout remains flat — all skills emitted at the top level as before. Antigravity moved from nested to flat in #1614: `agy` scans only `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, so nested sub-skills were unreachable. Claude was reverted to flat in #924: the Skill tool hard-errors on unknown names rather than re-routing via the router, so nested concrete skills were uninvokable.

The router descriptions use pipe-separated keyword tags (≤ 60 chars) per the Tool Attention research showing keyword-dense tags outperform prose for routing at ~40 % the token cost.

#### MCP token-budget interaction

The eager skill listing is one of two recurring per-turn token costs. The other is the MCP tool schema injected by every enabled MCP server in `.claude/settings.json`. Heavyweight MCP servers (browser/playwright, Mac-tools, Windows-tools) can each cost 20 k+ tokens per turn — often dwarfing what `model_profile` tuning saves. The toggle lives in the Claude Code harness (`enabledMcpjsonServers` / `disabledMcpjsonServers` in `.claude/settings.json`) and is **not** a GSD concern. Together, the two-stage routing layer (#2792) and disciplined MCP enablement are the largest cost levers per turn. See [`docs/USER-GUIDE.md`](USER-GUIDE.md) and `references/context-budget.md` for the audit checklist.

### Workflows (`gsd-core/workflows/*.md`)

Orchestration logic that commands reference. Contains the step-by-step process including:

- Context loading via `gsd-tools.cjs init` handlers
- Agent spawn instructions with model resolution
- Gate/checkpoint definitions
- State update patterns
- Error handling and recovery

**Total workflows:** see [`docs/INVENTORY.md`](INVENTORY.md#workflows) for the authoritative count and full roster.

#### Progressive disclosure for workflows

Workflow files are loaded verbatim into Claude's context every time the
corresponding `/gsd-*` command is invoked. The workflow size budget enforced by
`tests/workflow-size-budget.test.cjs` keeps each file bounded, mirroring the
the agent size-budget convention. The budget is measured in **bytes** (#717), not lines:
line count over-penalizes prose and under-catches token-dense tables and code
blocks, whereas bytes are deterministic and match the unit our vendors bound on
— Codex truncates instruction docs past 32,768 bytes (`project_doc_max_bytes`).
We adopt that unit, not that exact number: the XL/LARGE ceilings below sit above
32,768 because these are grandfathered top-level orchestrators loaded by Claude,
not Codex AGENTS.md docs.

| Tier      | Per-file byte limit |
|-----------|---------------------|
| `XL`      | 90,000 — top-level orchestrators (`execute-phase`, `plan-phase`, `new-project`) |
| `LARGE`   | 54,000 — multi-step planners and large feature workflows |
| `DEFAULT` | 38,000 — focused single-purpose workflows (the target tier) |

Ceilings are not fixed forever: under the tighten-only ratchet (#597) each one
tracks its tier's current high-water mark within a small grace band, so budgets
may only decrease over time.

**Why the budget exists.** With prompt caching the per-invocation *cost* of a
large workflow is modest (cache reads run ~10% of input). The stronger,
caching-independent reason is **quality**: as context grows, recall and
reasoning degrade ("context rot" / attention budget), so leaner, higher-signal
instructions produce better plans. The ceiling protects the agent's attention,
not just the token bill.

Because the budget measures one file, it is a proxy for the real goal —
*bounded loaded context*. Extraction only helps when the extracted content is
loaded **lazily** (Read at the step that needs it). Moving prose into a file
that is still eagerly `@`-imported shrinks the measured file without shrinking
loaded context, which games the proxy rather than serving the goal.

`workflows/discuss-phase.md` is held to a stricter <30,000-byte ceiling per
the discuss-phase byte budget (#717; the discuss-phase/modes split keeps it ≈32000 bytes). When a workflow grows
beyond its tier, extract per-mode bodies into
`workflows/<workflow>/modes/<mode>.md`, templates into
`workflows/<workflow>/templates/`, and shared knowledge into
`gsd-core/references/`. The parent file becomes a thin dispatcher that
Reads only the mode and template files needed for the current invocation.

`workflows/discuss-phase/` is the canonical example of this pattern —
parent dispatches, modes/ holds per-flag behavior (`power.md`, `all.md`,
`auto.md`, `chain.md`, `text.md`, `batch.md`, `analyze.md`, `default.md`,
`advisor.md`), and templates/ holds CONTEXT.md, DISCUSSION-LOG.md, and
checkpoint.json schemas that are read only when the corresponding output
file is being written.

`workflows/plan-phase.md`, `workflows/execute-phase.md`, and the
`gsd-planner` / `gsd-executor` agent definitions apply the same discipline
to their MVP-only reference bodies — `planner-mvp-mode.md`,
`user-story-template.md`, `skeleton-template.md`, and `execute-mvp-tdd.md`
are referenced for the planner/executor to Read only on MVP,
Walking-Skeleton, or MVP+TDD paths, rather than eagerly `@`-imported, so
non-MVP runs do not pay their context cost (guards against the "`@`-import
behind a conditional still loads eagerly" leak; see #720). The dedicated
`mvp-phase` workflow keeps its eager imports, since it is always MVP.

### Agents (`agents/*.md`)

Specialized agent definitions with frontmatter specifying:

- `name` — Agent identifier
- `description` — Role and purpose
- `tools` — Allowed tool access (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, etc.)
- `color` — Terminal output color for visual distinction

**Total agents:** 33

### References (`gsd-core/references/*.md`)

**Modular planner decomposition:**

The planner agent (`agents/gsd-planner.md`) was decomposed from a single monolithic file into a core agent plus reference modules to stay under the 50K character limit imposed by some runtimes:

- `planner-reviews.md` — Cross-AI review integration (reads REVIEWS.md from `/gsd-review`)
- `planner-revision.md` — Plan revision patterns for iterative refinement

### Templates (`gsd-core/templates/`)

Markdown templates for all planning artifacts. Used by `gsd-tools.cjs template fill` / `phase.scaffold` (and top-level `scaffold`) to create pre-structured files:
- `project.md`, `requirements.md`, `roadmap.md`, `state.md` — Core project files
- `phase-prompt.md` — Phase execution prompt template
- `summary.md` (+ `summary-minimal.md`, `summary-standard.md`, `summary-complex.md`) — Granularity-aware summary templates

See [`docs/INVENTORY.md`](INVENTORY.md#hooks) for the authoritative hook roster.

### Command Routing Hub (`gsd-core/bin/lib/command-routing-hub.cjs`)

CJS command family routers dispatch through `CommandRoutingHub`. The hub owns the no-throw pure-result contract (`hub.dispatch()` catches internal exceptions and returns `{ ok: false, kind, ...typedPayload }`) and the closed runtime error taxonomy (`UnknownCommand`, `InvalidArgs`, `HandlerRefusal`, `HandlerFailure`). Router adapters remain thin CLI translators — they build the hub, call `dispatch`, then map the Result to `output()`/`error()` calls. The runtime is single-path (no dual-runtime mode selection). See `docs/adr/0174-retire-gsd-sdk-package-boundary.md`.

### Capability Command Dispatch (`gsd-core/bin/gsd-tools.cjs`, ADR-1244 D7)

Command families declared by capabilities (`commands: [{ family, module, router }]`) are dispatched from the registry rather than a hardcoded switch. The `runCommand` default arm tries, in order:

1. **First-party** — `dispatchCapabilityCommand` against the frozen `capability-registry.cjs` `commandFamilies`, loading the router from `bin/lib/`. The in-tree families (`graphify`, `intel`, `audit`) reach their routers this way (the legacy hardcoded switch is retired).
2. **Third-party (installed overlay)** — `dispatchOverlayCapabilityCommand` calls `loadRegistry({ includeInstalled })` and dispatches a family only when its `capId` appears in `_overlay.commandRoots`. The loader lists a command root **only** for an accepted overlay capability with a **committed** ledger entry (consent gate), and the router module is `require()`'d **from that capability's install root**, confined by basename validation + `realpath` containment (rejecting `..` traversal and symlink escape). This is the one point where third-party capability code executes; see [the capability trust model](explanation/capability-trust-model.md) for the consent + confinement + project-scope trust boundary.

Both paths share the same guards: prototype-pollution-safe command keys, an own-property router check, and synchronous-only routers (an async router is a fail-fast error).

### Research Module (`src/research-{store,provider}.cts`, `src/package-legitimacy.cts`)

The Research Module implements an **L2-hybrid seam**: code owns the cache, provider policy, and package legitimacy verdicts; MCP owns the actual network fetch.

Three compiled modules (generated to `gsd-core/bin/lib/*.cjs` per ADR-457) are reachable via `gsd-tools query research-plan | research-store | package-legitimacy`:

- **Research Store** — content-addressed cache (`sha256(ecosystem+library+version+query+kind)`) with per-source TTL (curated-doc: 30 d, medium: 7 d, web/synthesis: 1 d) and two storage tiers: `~/.gsd/research-cache` for cross-project curated-doc hits, `.planning/research/.cache` for project-local web/synthesis results.
- **Research Provider** — single `PROVIDER_WATERFALL` (`Context7→Ref→Jina→websearch` for docs; `Exa→Tavily→Perplexity→Brave→websearch` for web; `Firecrawl→Jina` for scrape-only). `planResearch()` returns cache hits plus a fetch plan; `classifyConfidence()` stamps `HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW` by provider tier.
- **Package Legitimacy** — registry-API verdicts (npm/PyPI/crates.io injectable adapters) producing `OK|SUS|SLOP` per package. `slopcheck` is an optional escalate-only adapter; absence leaves registry verdicts intact rather than downgrading everything to `[ASSUMED]`.

**Data flow:**

```
agent
  │
  ▼
gsd-tools query research-plan          ← Research Provider: check cache, build fetch plan
  │
  ├── [cache hits] ──────────────────► RESEARCH.md (digest only, no raw content)
  │
  └── [fetch plan] ──────────────────► MCP fetch (agent calls MCP tools with the plan)
                                          │
                                          ▼
                                    gsd-tools query research-store (put)
                                          │
                                          ▼
                                    RESEARCH.md path returned to orchestrator
```

Agents always return a `RESEARCH.md` path, never raw fetched content. Context discipline is enforced through subagent isolation, compact provider output, and fetch-to-disk. See [ADR-0656](adr/0656-research-module-seam.md).

### CLI Tools (`gsd-core/bin/`)

| `security.cjs`         | Path traversal prevention, prompt injection detection, safe JSON parsing, shell argument validation |
| `uat.cjs`              | UAT file parsing, verification debt tracking, audit-uat support                                     |

| `capability-loader.cjs`    | Runtime registry overlay loader (ADR-1244 D2) — `loadRegistry({ includeInstalled })` composes the frozen first-party registry with a validated installed overlay of third-party capability manifests read from global `$GSD_HOME/.gsd/capabilities/` and project `<projectRoot>/.gsd/capabilities/`; first-party always wins; load-time `engines.gsd` re-gate skips incompatible overlays with a warning; gate-kind hooks on skipped capabilities fail OPEN — no gate is injected; a loud warning (stderr + envelope `warnings`) names the load failure and the `gsd capability remove <id>` remediation (#2009) |

### Wave Execution Model

During `execute-phase`, plans are grouped into dependency waves:

```
Wave Analysis:
  Plan 01 (no deps)      ─┐
  Plan 02 (no deps)      ─┤── Wave 1 (parallel)
  Plan 03 (depends: 01)  ─┤── Wave 2 (waits for Wave 1)
  Plan 04 (depends: 02)  ─┘
  Plan 05 (depends: 03,04) ── Wave 3 (waits for Wave 2)
```

Each executor gets:

- Fresh 200K context window (or up to 1M for models that support it)
- The specific PLAN.md to execute
- Project context (PROJECT.md, STATE.md)
- Phase context (CONTEXT.md, RESEARCH.md if available)

### Adaptive Context Enrichment (1M Models)

When the context window is 500K+ tokens (1M-class models like Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6), subagent prompts are automatically enriched with additional context that would not fit in standard 200K windows:

- **Executor agents** receive prior wave SUMMARY.md files and the phase CONTEXT.md/RESEARCH.md, enabling cross-plan awareness within a phase
- **Verifier agents** receive all PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md, CONTEXT.md files plus REQUIREMENTS.md, enabling history-aware verification

The orchestrator reads `context_window` from config (`gsd-tools.cjs config-get context_window`) and conditionally includes richer context when the value is >= 500,000. For standard 200K windows, prompts use truncated versions with cache-friendly ordering to maximize context efficiency.

#### Parallel Commit Safety

When multiple executors run within the same wave, two mechanisms prevent conflicts:

1. `--no-verify` commits — Parallel agents skip pre-commit hooks (which can cause build lock contention, e.g., cargo lock fights in Rust projects). The orchestrator runs `git hook run pre-commit` once after each wave completes.
2. **STATE.md file locking** — All `writeStateMd()` calls use lockfile-based mutual exclusion (`STATE.md.lock` with `O_EXCL` atomic creation). This prevents the read-modify-write race condition where two agents read STATE.md, modify different fields, and the last writer overwrites the other's changes. Includes stale lock detection (10s timeout) and spin-wait with jitter.

### Post-Execute Codebase Drift Gate (#2003)

After the last wave of `/gsd-execute-phase` commits, the workflow runs a
non-blocking `codebase_drift_gate` step (between `schema_drift_gate` and
`verify_phase_goal`). It compares the diff `last_mapped_commit..HEAD`
against `.planning/codebase/STRUCTURE.md` and counts four kinds of
structural elements:

1. New directories outside mapped paths
2. New barrel exports at `(packages|apps)/<name>/src/index.*`
3. New migration files
4. New route modules under `routes/` or `api/`

If the count meets `workflow.drift_threshold` (default 3), the gate either
**warns** (default) with the suggested `/gsd-map-codebase --paths …` command,
or **auto-remaps** (`workflow.drift_action = auto-remap`) by spawning
`gsd-codebase-mapper` scoped to the affected paths. Any error in detection
or remap is logged and the phase continues — drift detection cannot fail
verification.

`last_mapped_commit` lives in YAML frontmatter at the top of each
`.planning/codebase/*.md` file; `bin/lib/drift.cjs` provides
`readMappedCommit` and `writeMappedCommit` round-trip helpers.

## Installer Architecture

The installer (`bin/install.js`, ~10,700 lines) handles:

1. **Runtime detection** — Interactive prompt or CLI flags (`--claude`, `--opencode`, `--kimi`, `--kilo`, `--codex`, `--copilot`, `--antigravity`, `--cursor`, `--windsurf`, `--augment`, `--trae`, `--qwen`, `--hermes`, `--codebuddy`, `--cline`, `--all`)
2. **Location selection** — Global (`--global`) or local (`--local`)
3. **File deployment** — Copies commands, skills, workflows, references, templates, agents, and hooks
4. **Runtime adaptation** — Transforms file content per runtime:
  - Claude Code: Uses as-is
  - OpenCode: Converts commands/agents to OpenCode-compatible flat command + subagent format
  - Kilo: Reuses the OpenCode conversion pipeline with Kilo config paths
  - Codex: Generates TOML config + skills from commands
  - Kimi CLI: Generates Agent Skills under `skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, custom agent YAML/prompt files, and explicit `kimi_cli.tools.*` module paths
  - Copilot: Maps tool names (Read→read, Bash→execute, etc.)
  - Antigravity: Skills-first with Google model equivalents; adjusts hook event names (`AfterTool` instead of `PostToolUse`)
  - Cursor: Skills-first with Cursor rule references
  - Windsurf: Skills-first with Windsurf rule references
  - Trae: Skills-first install to `~/.trae` / `./.trae` with no `settings.json` or hook integration
  - Qwen Code: Skills-first with Qwen-branded path and prompt rewrites
  - Hermes Agent: Category-based skills under `skills/gsd/`
  - CodeBuddy: Skills-first with CodeBuddy path and prompt rewrites
  - Cline: Writes `.clinerules` for rule-based integration
  - Augment Code: Skills-first with full skill conversion and config management
5. **Path normalization** — Replaces `~/.claude/` paths with runtime-specific paths
6. **Settings integration** — Registers hooks in runtime's `settings.json`
7. **Patch backup** — Since v1.17, backs up locally modified files to `gsd-local-patches/` for `/gsd-update --reapply`
8. **Manifest tracking** — Writes `gsd-file-manifest.json` for clean uninstall
9. **Uninstall mode** — `--uninstall` removes all GSD files, hooks, and settings

Install-time file moves, stale-artifact cleanup, config rewrites, and user-data
preservation are governed by the Installer Migration Module. See
[Installer Migrations](installer-migrations.md) and
[ADR 0008](adr/0008-installer-migration-module.md).
The migration module also owns the gated first-time baseline scan for legacy
installs, classifying known runtime install surfaces before later migrations
remove or rewrite anything.

The plan drift guard (`plan_review.source_grounding`) — which verifies symbol references in generated plans against live source before execution — is specified in [ADR 22](adr/22-plan-drift-guard.md).

### Platform Handling

- **Windows:** `windowsHide` on child processes, EPERM/EACCES protection on protected directories, path separator normalization
- **WSL:** Detects Windows Node.js running on WSL and warns about path mismatches
- **Docker/CI:** Supports `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` env var for custom config directory locations

## Hook System

### Architecture

```
Runtime Engine (Claude Code / Antigravity CLI)
    │
    ├── statusLine event ──► gsd-statusline.js
    │   Reads: stdin (session JSON)
    │   Writes: stdout (formatted status), /tmp/claude-ctx-{session}.json (bridge)
    │
    ├── PostToolUse/AfterTool event ──► gsd-context-monitor.js
    │   Reads: stdin (tool event JSON), /tmp/claude-ctx-{session}.json (bridge)
    │   Writes: stdout (hookSpecificOutput with additionalContext warning)
    │
    └── SessionStart event
        ├──► gsd-ensure-canonical-path.js   (runs first)
        │    Reads:  ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/gsd-core/ (plugin installs only)
        │    Writes: ~/.claude/gsd-core/{bin,contexts,references,templates,workflows} symlinks
        │            (no-op in classic installs; preserves user files; self-heals)
        └──► gsd-check-update.js
             Reads:  VERSION file
             Writes: ~/.claude/cache/gsd-update-check.json (spawns background process)
```

### Context Monitor Thresholds


| Remaining Context | Level    | Agent Behavior                          |
| ----------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| > 35%             | Normal   | No warning injected                     |
| ≤ 35%             | WARNING  | "Avoid starting new complex work"       |
| ≤ 25%             | CRITICAL | "Context nearly exhausted, inform user" |


Debounce: 5 tool uses between repeated warnings. Severity escalation (WARNING→CRITICAL) bypasses debounce.

### Safety Properties

- All hooks wrap in try/catch, exit silently on error
- stdin timeout guard (3s) prevents hanging on pipe issues
- Stale metrics (>60s old) are ignored
- Missing bridge files handled gracefully (subagents, fresh sessions)
- Context monitor is advisory — never issues imperative commands that override user preferences

### Package Legitimacy Gate (v1.42.1)

The researcher → planner → executor pipeline includes a supply-chain gate against slopsquatting (AI-hallucinated package names pre-registered with malicious post-install scripts).

**Threat model:** GSD automates the full path from "researcher names a package" to "executor runs `npm install`". A hallucinated name that passes `npm view` (proving only registration, not legitimacy) would previously flow through undetected. ~20% of AI-generated package references are hallucinated; ~43% of those names recur consistently across prompts, making pre-registration economically viable for attackers.

**Gate layers:**

| Layer | Component | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Research | `gsd-phase-researcher` | Runs `slopcheck install <pkgs> --json`; writes `## Package Legitimacy Audit` table to RESEARCH.md; strips `[SLOP]` packages before RESEARCH.md is written |
| Planning | `gsd-planner` | Reads Audit table; inserts `checkpoint:human-verify` before any `[ASSUMED]` or `[SUS]` install task; adds `T-{phase}-SC` STRIDE supply-chain row to `<threat_model>` |
| Execution | `gsd-executor` | RULE 3 excludes package installation from auto-fix scope; failed installs surface as checkpoints, never silent substitutions |

**Claim provenance integration:** Package names discovered via WebSearch are tagged `[ASSUMED]` (not `[VERIFIED]`) regardless of `npm view` result. This extends the existing `[ASSUMED]` / `[VERIFIED]` / `[CITED]` provenance system by enforcing the provenance tag as a hard gate at the install boundary — `[ASSUMED]` always generates a `checkpoint:human-verify` in PLAN.md.

**Ecosystem coverage:** The researcher uses registry-specific verification commands — `npm view` (Node), `pip index versions` (Python), `cargo search` (Rust) — rather than a single generic check. This catches cross-ecosystem hallucination (~9% rate documented in 2025 USENIX research).

**Graceful degradation:** If `slopcheck` is unavailable, every recommended package is tagged `[ASSUMED]` and gated with a checkpoint. Research and planning proceed; the system never hard-fails on a missing tool dependency.

**External dependency:** `slopcheck` (MIT, pip-installable). If abandoned, the `[ASSUMED]`-gate fallback maintains human-checkpoint coverage.

### Security Hooks (v1.27)

For a conceptual overview of how the hook and guard layers fit into the broader security approach, see [Security model](explanation/security-model.md).

**Prompt Guard** (`gsd-prompt-guard.js`):

- Triggers on Write/Edit to `.planning/` files
- Scans content for prompt injection patterns (role override, instruction bypass, system tag injection)
- Advisory-only — logs detection, does not block
- Patterns are inlined (subset of `security.cjs`) for hook independence

**Workflow Guard** (`gsd-workflow-guard.js`):

- Triggers on Write/Edit to non-`.planning/` files
- Detects edits outside GSD workflow context (no active `/gsd-` command or Task subagent)
- Advises using `/gsd-quick` or `/gsd-fast` for state-tracked changes
- Opt-in via `hooks.workflow_guard: true` (default: false)

## Runtime Abstraction

GSD supports multiple AI coding runtimes through a unified command/workflow architecture:

### Runtime Install Contract Matrix

This matrix describes the runtime surfaces the installer materializes today.
The migration-specific ownership and source snapshots live in
[Installer Migrations](installer-migrations.md#runtime-configuration-contract-registry).

| Runtime | Global root | Local root | Invocation surface | Agent surface | Config and hooks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude` | `./.claude` | Global `skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md` (flat, #924); local `commands/gsd/*.md` | `agents/gsd-*.md` | `settings.json` hook and statusLine entries |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode` | `./.opencode` | `command/gsd-*.md` | `agents/gsd-*.md` | `opencode.json` or `opencode.jsonc`; no GSD hooks |
| Kilo | `~/.config/kilo` | `./.kilo` | `command/gsd-*.md` | `agents/gsd-*.md` | `kilo.json` or `kilo.jsonc`; no GSD hooks |
| Kimi CLI | First-existing generic root: `~/.config/agents` recommended, then `~/.agents` when `~/.agents/skills` exists and `~/.config/agents/skills` does not | Deferred and guarded | `skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md` (flat) invoked as `/skill:gsd-*` | `agents/gsd.yaml`, `agents/gsd.md`, and `agents/subagents/gsd-*` YAML/prompt pairs | Explicit `kimi --agent-file <configRoot>/agents/gsd.yaml`; no GSD hooks or statusline |
| Codex | `~/.codex` | `./.codex` | `skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md` (flat) | `agents/` source markdown plus per-agent TOML | `config.toml` `[agents.gsd-*]`, `[features].hooks` (canonical; legacy alias `codex_hooks` is recognized and migrated forward on reinstall, #3566), and hook tables |
| GitHub Copilot | `~/.copilot` | `./.github` | `skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md` (flat), `copilot-instructions.md`, and `AGENTS.md` (repo root, local) | `.agent.md` files | Self-contained `sessionStart` hook (`hooks/gsd-session.json`, inline `command` type); no statusline |
| Antigravity | auto-detected: `~/.gemini/antigravity`, `~/.gemini/antigravity-ide`, or `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli` | `./.agent` | `skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md` (flat, #1614) | `agents/gsd-*.md` | Gemini-style `settings.json` hook entries when installed by GSD |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor` | `./.cursor` | `skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md` (flat) | `agents/gsd-*.md` | Rule references under `rules/`; `hooks.json` with sessionStart context injection and postToolUse STATE.md monitor (#777) |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf` config | `./.windsurf` | `workflows/gsd-*.md` slash-command workflows | No custom-agent artifact surface | No GSD hooks |
| Augment Code | `~/.augment` | `./.augment` | `skills/gsd-ns-*/SKILL.md` (6 routers) + `skills/gsd-ns-*/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (nested concretes) | `agents/gsd-*.md` | No GSD hooks or statusline |
| Trae | `~/.trae` | `./.trae` | `skills/gsd-ns-*/SKILL.md` (6 routers) + `skills/gsd-ns-*/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (nested concretes) | `agents/gsd-*.md` | Rule references under `rules/`; no GSD hooks |
| Qwen Code | `~/.qwen` | `./.qwen` | `skills/gsd-ns-*/SKILL.md` (6 routers) + `skills/gsd-ns-*/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (nested concretes) | `agents/gsd-*.md` | Common GSD settings and hook entries where supported |
| Hermes Agent | `~/.hermes` | `./.hermes` | `skills/gsd/ns-*/SKILL.md` (6 routers, prefix='') + `skills/gsd/ns-*/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (nested concretes) | `agents/gsd-*.md` | Common GSD settings and hook entries where supported |
| CodeBuddy | `~/.codebuddy` | `./.codebuddy` | `skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md` (flat, `user-invocable: false`) | `agents/gsd-*.md` | `/gsd-*` slash commands under `commands/`; common GSD settings and hook entries where supported |
| Cline | `~/.cline` | project root | `skills/gsd-ns-*/SKILL.md` (6 routers) + `skills/gsd-ns-*/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (nested concretes) + `.clinerules` | Rules only | No GSD hooks or statusline |

### Upstream Contract Sources

Runtime install expectations are checked against primary documentation where
available. The current source snapshot is 2026-05-11, with Kimi CLI rechecked
on 2026-06-07:

- Claude Code: Anthropic slash commands, settings, hooks, and subagents docs.
- OpenCode and Kilo: OpenCode config docs and Kilo custom subagent docs.
- Qwen Code: command/config docs; Qwen command docs were last
  updated 2026-05-06.
- Kimi CLI: Agent Skills docs for user-level brand roots and first-existing
  generic roots (`~/.config/agents/skills/` recommended, then
  `~/.agents/skills/`), plus Agents docs for YAML files, `system_prompt_path`,
  `kimi_cli.tools.*` module paths, and explicit `kimi --agent-file` launch.
- Codex: OpenAI Codex docs and `config-schema.json`; the installer also carries
  Codex 0.124.0 compatibility for agent table shape.
- Copilot, Cursor, Cline, Augment, Hermes, and CodeBuddy: vendor docs for
  custom instructions, rules, skills, or config.
- Antigravity, Windsurf, and Trae: source-limited rows. The installer documents
  current compatibility shims, and migrations must refresh those sources before
  rewriting their config.

### Abstraction Points

1. **Tool name mapping** — Each runtime has its own tool names (e.g., Claude's `Bash` → Copilot's `execute`)
2. **Hook event names** — Claude uses `PostToolUse`, Antigravity uses `AfterTool`
3. **Agent frontmatter** — Each runtime has its own agent definition format
4. **Path conventions** — Each runtime stores config in different directories
5. **Model references** — `inherit` profile lets GSD defer to runtime's model selection

The installer handles all translation at install time. Workflows and agents are written in Claude Code's native format and transformed during deployment.
