**A green `/gsd-verify-work` run no longer leaves its own verification report stale** — verify-work and autonomous stopped re-running the security, validation and UI-review steps after the fingerprint when their file already exists, a complete UAT is no longer rewritten and committed on resume, and a re-audit whose counts match the previous audit no longer appends a duplicate dated block. A genuinely changed audit still writes and still marks the report stale. (#5105)
