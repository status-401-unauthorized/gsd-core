**`/gsd-map-codebase --fast` now actually runs the fast scan** — the flag routed to "the scan workflow" in prose but named no path any runtime could resolve, and the command loaded only the full four-agent map workflow, so `scan.md` was never read and the single-agent scan was improvised rather than executed. (#3561)
