**The plan drift guard now flags the same fact stated two ways** — when ROADMAP.md, PLAN.md, STATE.md and CONTEXT.md contradict each other about a phase status, a success criterion, a requirement ID or a domain term, plan review reports it in REVIEWS.md naming both locations and which one is authoritative, instead of letting a fresh-context agent act on the stale copy. The phase-status axis is decided deterministically rather than by judgment, so a STATE/ROADMAP contradiction is caught the same way every time — and a disagreement about whether a phase is *complete* is always reported, never written off as one document lagging the other. Advisory only; it never blocks convergence, and the judgment axes key on contradicting knowledge rather than similar-looking text. Runs under the existing `plan_review.source_grounding` switch — no new setting. (#1956)
