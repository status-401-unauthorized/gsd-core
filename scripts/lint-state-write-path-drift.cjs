/**
 * Anti-divergence drift guard for the STATE.md WRITE PATH — epic #3408, issue
 * #3468, ADR-3408 Decision 5, contract §8.1/§8.2/§8.3
 * (`docs/adr/3408-state-write-path-preservation.md` is the contract this
 * guard enforces; read it first).
 *
 * TWO AXES, ONE GUARD, because they fail together — a table that is
 * bypassed on dispatch and a seam that is bypassed on write are the same
 * failure mode ("policy declared, enforcement hand-rolled") applied to two
 * different call shapes:
 *
 *   AXIS 1 — POLICY DISPATCH (§8.1). `applyStatePreservation` must select
 *   its branch from a `FIELD_CLASSIFICATION` row's `preservation` value,
 *   never from a field NAME. Every `getFieldClassification('<string
 *   literal>')` inside `src/state-transition.cts` is a field-name-keyed
 *   branch — the shape that let four declared rows go unimplemented until
 *   #3258, and that leaves `derive` and `clear` with no executor today. A
 *   VARIABLE argument (`getFieldClassification(field)`) is the CORRECT
 *   table-driven shape and is deliberately NOT matched. Also matched: a
 *   direct `field === '<literal>'` / `field !== '<literal>'` / `'<literal>'
 *   === field` comparison of the dispatch loop's own `field` variable — the
 *   same prohibited shape routed AROUND `getFieldClassification` instead of
 *   through it (#3468 found this exact form live in `applyPreserveIfPlaceholder`,
 *   undetected by the call-shape check alone). Scoped to the identifier
 *   `field` only; see `FIELD_VAR_EQ_LITERAL_RE`'s own comment for why.
 *
 *   AXIS 2 — WRITE SEAM (§8.3), RATCHETED. `readModifyWriteStateMd` is the
 *   only path meant to write STATE.md. Every direct `writeStateMd(` or
 *   `syncStateFrontmatter(` call outside the owner's own definitions is a
 *   bypass that skips preservation and the #948 no-op guard — how #3374 and
 *   #3350 reproduce. This axis ships RATCHETED (see below), never a bare
 *   0-or-fail check.
 *
 * DESIGN CONSTRAINTS (ADR-3180 Decision 4, adopted verbatim by ADR-3408):
 *   - 4(a) whole-repo scan, never an allowlist. ADR-3180's own phases found
 *     26/5/54 copies where their epics scoped 3/3/4 — a scoped guard earns
 *     nothing.
 *   - 4(d) the scan surface is DECLARED and is NOT just `src/` — `src/`
 *     alone is itself an allowlist one directory wide; #1762 traced a wrong
 *     count to a shell snippet in `gsd-core/workflows/progress.md`. And
 *     inward: the OWNER FILE (`src/state.cts`) is not exempt, only its
 *     named canonical FUNCTIONS are (`SEAM_OWNER_EXEMPT_FUNCTIONS` below).
 *   - 4(e) Axis 2 ships ratcheted because Phase 1 (this file) cannot
 *     consolidate the write seam — that is Phase 2 (#3469). Landing a
 *     guard later, against an already-clean tree, is the "found it, wrote
 *     it down, moved on" posture the epic removes.
 *
 * GOODHART, PER ADR-3408 DECISION 5: "0 bypasses" is a LAGGING metric — a
 * measure about to become a target. This guard's own `_comment` and its
 * human-readable success message both say so: the zero this guard reports
 * must NEVER be quoted alone; it is only meaningful beside the behavioral
 * identity test's result (the consumer-output assertion Decision 5's gaming
 * table names as the actual defense).
 *
 * String literals are matched, never parsed as an AST — deliberately, per
 * `scripts/lint-state-field-drift.cjs`'s own precedent: over-reporting
 * (flagging a comment or a string that merely looks like a call) is safe;
 * under-reporting (missing a real bypass) is the failure this guard exists
 * to prevent. `stripComments` does not track quoted strings for exactly
 * this reason — see its own header.
 *
 * AXIS 3 — FRONTMATTER-SHAPED WRITE (§8.3(b)), CLOSED IN PHASE 2 (#3469).
 * Phase 1 left this as a DECLARED KNOWN GAP: `patchCore` ran
 * `stateReplaceField(` over the WHOLE document (body + frontmatter) instead
 * of stripping frontmatter first, the way `updateCore` does, and a naive
 * co-occurrence approximation ("does the enclosing function also call
 * `stripFrontmatter(`?") measured at 33 occurrences of `stateReplaceField(`,
 * of which only 4 were genuine write-seam bypasses and 29 were noise — the
 * definition of `stateReplaceField` itself, ~20 calls on `sectionBody` (a
 * body slice that is frontmatter-free by construction), and several calls
 * inside `readModifyWriteStateMd` callbacks. 29 false positives to 1 true
 * positive would have buried the signal.
 *
 * Phase 2 fixes `patchCore` (it now strips frontmatter first, matching
 * `updateCore`) AND closes the gap, using a narrower, two-factor shape that
 * does not reproduce that ratio: `findUnstrippedContentWrites` below flags a
 * `stateReplaceField(` call only when BOTH (a) its field-name argument is a
 * VARIABLE, not a fixed string literal — every OTHER call site in
 * `EXECUTOR_FILE` passes a fixed Title-Case literal (`'Phase'`, `'Total
 * Plans in Phase'`, ...) that can never collide with a lowercase/snake_case
 * YAML frontmatter key, so a literal field name is never a candidate
 * regardless of whether its content argument is stripped — and (b) its
 * content argument has not been run through `stripFrontmatter` first,
 * checked by a simple backward scan (within the same function) for the
 * nearest preceding assignment to that argument's variable name. This is
 * deliberately NOT full alias/dataflow tracking — see the function's own
 * docstring for the narrow, documented limitation this trades for
 * tractability.

 *      the baseline may only shrink (via `--baseline`, regenerated) —
 *      `BASELINE_ENTRY_STALE`.
