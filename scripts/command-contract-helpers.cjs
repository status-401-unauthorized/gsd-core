/**
 * workflowPathRefs(content)
 *
 * Locates every gsd-core-relative workflow path referenced in a markdown
 * string, whether the reference is an eager @-include (already covered by
 * executionContextRefs) or a *lazy* path mentioned only in prose/code — a
 * path a command reads on demand via Read/Bash rather than an @-inclusion
 * the harness inlines automatically. Both kinds are load-bearing: the
 * progressive-disclosure split (#717) deliberately keeps most workflow
 * content out of the eager path so the common case stays cheap, but that
 * means a command naming a workflow only in prose is invisible to
 * executionContextRefs even though the runtime still needs the file to
 * exist. Recognizes three reference shapes:
 *
 *   A. Any path whose segments include `workflows/`, optionally preceded by
 *      an eager `@`, a home-dir prefix (`~/` or `$HOME/`), `.claude/`, and/or
 *      `gsd-core/` — e.g. `@~/.claude/gsd-core/workflows/scan.md`,
 *      `gsd-core/workflows/x.md`, or a bare `workflows/x.md`.
 *   B. Same as A but without the eager `@` — a lazy reference read on
 *      demand rather than inlined at load time.
 *   C. Parent-relative sub-file paths with no `workflows/` prefix at all —
 *      `execute-phase/steps/post-merge-gate.md` — implicitly rooted under
 *      `workflows/` because that's the only place `steps/`, `modes/`, and
 *      `templates/` subdirectories live.
 *
 * Traversal segments (`..`) are dropped rather than surfaced: this resolver
 * only ever reports paths under `workflows/`, never something a `..` could
 * walk outside of it. Results are de-duplicated, first-seen order preserved.
 *
 * Both regexes anchor `\.md` with a trailing `(?![A-Za-z0-9_])` negative
 * lookahead so a longer extension (`.mdx`, `.md5`) is rejected outright
 * rather than silently truncated into a plausible-looking `.md` path.

/**
 * unreachableWorkflows(loaderContents, gsdFiles, workflowPaths)
 *
 * Computes reachability over the gsd-core file graph and reports which
 * `workflowPaths` are never reached, starting only from `loaderContents`
 * (commands/agents/skills — the files a runtime actually loads) and walking
 * `workflowPathRefs` edges transitively through `gsdFiles`.
 *
 * The seed set is deliberately restricted to loaders and never includes a
 * workflow's own content. Seeding from workflows too would let two failure
 * modes hide: a workflow that only references itself would satisfy its own
 * reachability, and a pair of workflows that reference only each other would
 * form an island that looks connected from the inside but that no command,
 * agent, or skill ever actually opens. Both are orphans in every sense that
 * matters — nothing external can reach them — and both must be reported.
 * Requiring every path to originate at a loader is what makes "reachable"
 * mean "a runtime can actually get here," not merely "something points to
 * it."
 *
 * `gsdFiles` covers all of `gsd-core/**`, not just `workflows/`, because a
 * `references/` or `templates/` file can itself name a workflow path and
 * needs to be walked through to propagate reachability — restricting the map
 * to `workflows/` would silently break any chain that passes through a
 * non-workflow file.
 *
 * `visited` guards the walk against reference cycles (including the
 * mutual/self cases above) so traversal always terminates.
