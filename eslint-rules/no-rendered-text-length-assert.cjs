/**
 * no-rendered-text-length-assert
 *
 * Enforces ADR-456's typed-surface mandate for one specific bug shape: a test
 * assertion whose pass/fail depends on the LENGTH (or a substring match sensitive
 * to length) of a rendered/templated string that embeds an OS-derived path
 * (os.tmpdir(), os.homedir(), path.join/resolve/…, or a project resolver from
 * PATH_RETURNING_FNS). Because macOS's default tmpdir prefix
 * (`/private/var/folders/…`) is longer than Linux's, such an assertion can pass
 * on one OS and fail on another — the exact shape behind #4421's incident
 * (`git show 4e75b836e9`, `tests/state-todos-render.test.cjs`).
 *
 * Triggers on:
 *   <rendered-text>.length <op> <numeric-literal>   (op: > < >= <= === !== == !=)
 *   <rendered-text>.includes|startsWith|endsWith(<literal>)
 *   assert.match(<rendered-text>, /regex/)
 * where <rendered-text> is (directly, or via one identifier hop) a TEMPLATE
 * LITERAL that interpolates a path-returning expression. A bare path-returning
 * call used as the receiver on its own — e.g. `path.join(a, b).length > 240`
 * or `const p = path.resolve(a, b); p.endsWith('.md')` — is NEVER flagged: the
 * hazard this rule targets only exists when the path's OS-dependent length is
 * embedded alongside OTHER rendered content, not when a path value is probed
 * directly about its own shape.
 *
 * DEFECT category: this rule is not itself a `DEFECT.WINDOWS-*` class (the
 * failure axis is tmpdir LENGTH across POSIX runners, not a Windows-vs-POSIX
 * separator/behavior difference) — it is an ADR-456 typed-surface-mandate
 * enforcement extension. See docs/adr/1703-portability-enforcement-architecture.md's
 * rule catalog for how it is cataloged alongside the `DEFECT.WINDOWS-*` rules.
 *
 * ── Taint model ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ONE identifier hop: if the asserted-on expression is a bare Identifier,
 * resolve it to its `const`/`let` declarator initializer in the enclosing
 * scope, then check whether THAT resolved expression is a TEMPLATE LITERAL
 * with at least one interpolated expression that is directly a path-returning
 * call. A resolved expression that is itself directly a path-returning call
 * (no template literal involved) is NOT taint — only interpolation into a
 * larger rendered string counts. No further
 * inference through call arguments — a call's return value is not assumed to
 * embed its own arguments' content just because one argument happens to be a
 * path (a function receiving a path argument does not necessarily embed that
 * path in its output; distinguishing genuinely path-embedding renderers from
 * ordinary path-consuming functions like fs.readFileSync would require
 * tracing into the callee's body, which is out of scope for a single-file AST
 * rule — see Known boundaries (d) below, added after a repo-wide sweep with
 * the ORIGINAL two-hop design found this exact false-positive shape live in
 * the existing suite: `assert.match(md, /regex/)` where
 * `md = fs.readFileSync(path.join(...))` was flagged purely because
 * readFileSync's argument was a path, not because its return text embeds one.
 *
 * A template literal is checked by inspecting its interpolated expressions
 * directly (no extra hop spent) — `` `foo ${path.join(a,b)} bar` `` is 0-hop
 * taint at the point it is written.
 *
 * ── Known boundaries ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * (a) Function-parameter provenance is not traced. If the path-tainted value
 *     arrives as a parameter to the enclosing function/callback rather than a
 *     local `const`/`let` declaration, there is no declarator initializer to
 *     resolve to and the rule does not flag it.
 *
 * (b) Name-based matching only, inherited from portability-vocab.cjs's
 *     PATH_RETURNING_FNS: a shadowed local `path`/`os` identifier is STILL
 *     treated as the real module (matching sibling rule no-path-literal-in-assert's
 *     own documented boundary) — this can rarely over-fire on a shadowed name,
 *     an accepted precedent already shipped in this catalog.
 *
 * (c) Does not re-derive the production truncation threshold. This rule flags
 *     the test-side anti-pattern (asserting on rendered text that embeds a
 *     path), not the specific numeric boundary that made any one incident
 *     OS-specific — that would require analyzing the render function's own
 *     body, which is out of scope for a single-file test-lint rule.
 *
 * (d) Does not trace through any function call's arguments to infer that the
 *     call's return value embeds them. This means the LITERAL historical
 *     #4421/#2618 incident shape (a call to a cross-file production render
 *     function, e.g. `renderPendingTodoBullet({ filePath: tmpFile })`, whose
 *     return value happens to embed the argument) is NOT detected by this
 *     rule — that would require tracing into the callee's body (a different,
 *     heavier kind of analysis, evaluated and rejected — see
 *     .gsd/phase/chore-4590-rendered-text-length-assert/40-design.md
 *     "Rejected" #2). What IS detected is the same defect class written
 *     directly in the test file: a template literal that itself interpolates
 *     a path-returning expression, then has its length/substring probed. A
 *     repo-wide sweep with an earlier, broader version of this rule (tracing
 *     into call arguments) found this was the only way to keep the rule
 *     sound: it produced dozens of false positives on ordinary
 *     `fs.readFileSync(path.join(...))` + `assert.match` patterns, which are
 *     correct code, not instances of this defect.
 *
 * (e) Does not flag a bare path-returning call used directly as the receiver
 *     (with no surrounding template literal) — e.g. `path.join(a, b).length
 *     > 240`, `full.endsWith('.md')`, `resolved.startsWith(root)`, or
 *     `dir.length > 0`. Asserting a property of a path value itself (its own
 *     suffix, prefix, non-emptiness, or exact length) is a direct,
 *     deterministic check on that path — not an assertion about SOME OTHER
 *     rendered content that happens to share a string with a variable-length
 *     path — so it is not the target defect class. A repo-wide sweep with an
 *     earlier version of this rule that matched ANY direct path-returning
 *     call (with or without a template literal) found 45 false positives of
 *     exactly this shape across `tests/` — file-extension checks, path-
 *     confinement checks, and non-emptiness checks — none of which are
 *     instances of #4421's OS-tmpdir-length hazard.
