/**
 * no-duplicate-fold-marker
 *
 * Flag a `folded:<name>` marker that appears more than once in the same file.
 *
 * Consolidation epic #1969 moved standalone regression suites into shared host
 * files. Each moved suite is wrapped in a self-contained block:
 *
 *   // ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   // Folded from tests/bug-376-claude-js-hook-gsd-rewriter.test.cjs — …
 *   // ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   {
 *     const { describe: __foldDescribe } = require('node:test');
 *     __foldDescribe("folded:bug-376-claude-js-hook-gsd-rewriter (… B1 #1970)", () => {
 *       …
 *     });
 *   }
 *
 * Because each block is self-contained, a second verbatim copy in the same host
 * parses, registers, and PASSES — twice. Nothing reports it. #3271 found 25 such
 * copies (~5,800 lines) across three suites, all introduced by one stale-base
 * re-application in `6d072435d` (#1975 re-applying #1970's hunks).
 *
 * Two concrete costs, both invisible to a green suite:
 *   1. Every duplicated block executes twice on every lane of the matrix.
 *   2. DEFECT.GENERATIVE-FIX — a contributor fixing one of these regressions
 *      edits the copy they found and leaves the other asserting the old
 *      behavior. The suite stays green while the two copies disagree.
 *
 * ── What is keyed ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The marker is the WHITESPACE-DELIMITED token after `folded:` in the title
 * literal passed to the fold alias — NOT the whole title, and NOT a
 * `[a-z0-9-]*` slice of it.
 *
 *   "folded:bug-376-claude-js-hook-gsd-rewriter (consolidation epic #1969 B1 #1970)"
 *    → marker `bug-376-claude-js-hook-gsd-rewriter`
 *
 * Both halves of that definition are load-bearing:
 *
 *   (a) Stopping at whitespace and NOT at `.` keeps
 *       `feat-443-effort-fast-mode.integration` distinct from
 *       `feat-443-effort-fast-mode`. Those are two different folded suites that
 *       coexist in tests/model-resolver.test.cjs; a `[a-z0-9-]*` key collides
 *       them and reports a duplicate that does not exist (#3271's own
 *       reproduction command has this bug).
 *
 *   (b) Keying on the marker rather than the full title means a re-fold under a
 *       different batch label ("… B1 #1970" vs "… B5 #1975") is still caught.
 *       The batch label is provenance, not identity.
 *
 * ── What is deliberately NOT flagged ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   - A `__foldDescribe` title without a `folded:` prefix. The alias is reused
 *     for at least one ordinary describe block
 *     (tests/review-default-reviewers-workflow.test.cjs). Those are not folds
 *     and carry no uniqueness obligation.
 *   - A plain `describe("folded:…")`. The convention this rule enforces is the
 *     fold alias; a bare `describe` with a colliding title is a different
 *     (and currently non-existent) shape.
 *   - A non-literal title (`__foldDescribe(name, …)`, template literal with a
 *     substitution). Nothing can be proven about it statically, so it is
 *     skipped rather than guessed at.
 *   - The SAME marker in two DIFFERENT files. The defect class is intra-file
 *     duplication — one host running one suite twice. Cross-file reuse would be
 *     a different question and is not decided here.
 *   - A call through an ALIAS of the alias (`const d = __foldDescribe; d("folded:a …")`).
 *     The rule keys on the callee identifier being literally `__foldDescribe`;
 *     resolving a further alias through scope would buy nothing today — every
 *     one of the 365 fold sites in the tree calls the alias directly, and zero
 *     rebind it — while adding a scope walk to a rule that currently needs none.
 *     If a rebinding ever appears, it is the rebinding that is the anomaly.
 *
 * The rule reports the SECOND and every subsequent occurrence, never the first,
 * and names the line the first occurrence sits on — so the failure message
 * points at both ends of the duplication.
 *
